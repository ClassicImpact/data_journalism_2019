146 : It's not pretty, rather than continuing to say it's pretty

154 : Trapped feelings ᆢ

162 : I don't like it

169 : I feel so happy when you open every single product. If someone reviews a sports car, I don't care about the guys who are jealous that they are luxury

175 : The far right is no jam

1657 : I envy you.

342 : No matter how much I think about it, I like to cut 1/3 of fruit and give me a small spoon of ice cream.

343 : At least silver cutlery inherits a good house from their parents, gets a good tea, and squeaks to live, feeling sick and deprived. Even the parents are not ready for retirement, but they are getting married and taking away their old funds. Such human beings cry out that they feel rich and deprived. How contradictory is this? Human beings with different words and actions can never succeed, and if they masturbate in their contradictions for the rest of their lives, they will live. I firmly believe that these contradictory people will play that role. The Republic of Korea has never invaded another country and has always been attacked. As a result, they are always self-defense and inferior. The old saying that a cousin hurts when a land is bought is still due to its peculiar ethnicity. Featured and scientific.

349 : I just envy you

351 : Empty and uninteresting. That

362 : Would you go to the bad guys?

363 : No matter how young you are,

413 : How do you live so high? I'm scared

429 : No, you have a lot of money.

432 : Why are you a luxury howl? After all, it's a lot of money ... or a conglomerate daughter ... a bag of money that's meaningless to the common people.

440 : Lotto won't even win 2 ㅋㅋ

443 : Overseas Capristo exhaust sounds aren't really fun

447 : Life is short enough to envy others. It is only a small part of your short life.

453 : Isn't it clear? I've changed ...

455 : There is only one landlord, or a gambling site operator or illegal business owner.

462 : Second House ..... I envy you.

467 : Right righteous jealousy of Avensa: Because it was made with no effort from the point of view of driving hard earned and self-made.

469 : I was wondering why Korean men (Jul'Thin) hated luxury so much, but now they realize that it's not that they don't like it. I hate women of luxury. Men consider women to be unconditional, frugal, and sacrifice to themselves and their children. But does such a woman carry luxury? It's a crazy year, a vanity year. Of course, the manifestation of their thoughts would be their lack of ability (financial, appearance, etc.). The men collect luxury goods, they look like brothers and keep them cool.

474 : But if you live anyway, I don't think it's inspirational.

478 : It's an envy

482 :  When people in their 20s, who are in their 20s, do luxury goods, they were recognized as 'a man who wanted to spend a lot of money' and 'a desperate person who couldn't wear one's own clothes'. I look at the comments and I feel sorry for my heart

488 : No, I just came in to see the luxury I wanted to see this one word of explanation

489 : I don't want to look right in the leather jacket.

494 : Right would have been difficult because of him.

508 : Why can't I live for free? The administration fee is very expensive

516 : Louis Vuitton bag that you wrote down in the details of Hanbyeol is a bit mistaken.

519 : The screen is too messy

526 : Because the gap is so big, I have a feeling of deprivation

532 : Fuck it all

541 : I have to die.

546 : I'm so deprived ....

554 : Are you not happy with their house? I think it's worth playing around all the time

560 : Ferrago Lamborghini and everything ruined

600 : I don't even want a conglomerate

605 : I wanted to introduce a variety of products, so I elaborately took a video, but I clicked this video among many YouTube videos. What is the reason? I don't buy baggage money, but I don't buy baggage money. But instead of my older sister who has the ability to buy luxury goods, I feel that it is fun because there are many people with different tastes in this world. If you get angry and depressed, don't just look. Why do negative comments make subscribers and subscribers feel depressed?

606 : Oh, no, no depression. When you're in the room, you don't talk.

608 : Damn that first class ride too ... ㅎ ㅎㅎㅎ

1186 : I'm suddenly unhappy to see this

614 : I want to shake your right hand, but I don't know and you can't accept it.

619 : A man who lives alone wears gloves while cooking

620 : I am not happy at home and I am not good at homeowners .... Modern landlords are good at cooking. I envy you

623 : The ad is full, the flow of oil is cut off

624 : I'm just envious of you

699 : I live in Abu Dhabi, but I've been to Dubai a lot. There's a tropical Ferrari, not a Ferrari. I don't just lie in the parking lot of the apartment. Rolls-Royce and Ferrari are just watching every day. Well, it's not a good apartment.

704 : Japanese boycott

712 : There are a lot of bad guys who don't consider their efforts to set up a gold rice bowl.

713 : 3.5 billion, I thought it was a big mansion with a huge pool. It's a huge house price, no garden, no swimming pool, and it's frustrating, I just think there's 3.5 billion homes in Seoul with only a few more rooms.
