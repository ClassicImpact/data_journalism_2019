Seulgi is a good subscriber to watch the video! I'm saying that the structure of the house in the video? I don't know until now, but I think you should watch the elevator and the place where you live. „Ö† „Ö° „Ö† I've seen other women's YouTube videos, but I heard that a strange man found a house and stalked it! I didn't know ..
How old are you?
wisdom? Thrash? Garbage!
You didn't fit in the s group and the Australian sweepers are good. Perhaps more people are against it. Some people are in the middle of it. It's inclination. Personality.
I'm so curious to calculate the tip> I really want to go to the raiover quickly as a flight attendant
Can you tell me where the bedding is?

You have a drink sugar like that. How do you adjust that? The ratio is different, sugar or syrup is added in?
If you're envious, tell me you're envious, don't be sarcastic.
I'm embarrassed that my first encounter is teething.
I love you
I went to Australia in 13 years and had been in a small factory for 2 years, but when I was a year and a half in Kilfrore, I thought I would go to Korea because of physical difficulties. I'm really sympathetic with work and spare sleep. It's been a year and a half since I came to Korea and I miss Australia with fine dust. Please get a green card
I'm a fan of you
This video feels moist! I'm looking forward to the upcoming vlogs!
Ah, and if you are technically interested and interested, why not learn more about heavy machinery than cars?
Is there a lot of people who have applied for so many?
I think it's slime.
I resign in 4/01 and leave on 30th. I'm so tired ~ I hate it so much that I want to kill myself by throwing stress on my family at some point. This is not ... This is not ...
What are you using for the camera? What do you use for editing programs? haha
Congratulation! you gained 1 subscriber !!

I wonder if there is no happy job in Korea.
Fighting
Lol
And basically, Korea is also highly dependent on exports, right? It's hard to eat and live in the domestic market, and even in Japan, it's enough to live in Korea.
It feels like watching a Junior Naver Cafe Tycoon game
4:03 2500 won .. ???????
I'm so pretty that I keep seeing ...

I'm a Hong Kong foreigner (like a consumable from a big company ...) I've never been happy working here for over 10 years ...

The Korean president has been working hard for a year, and at that time, he didn't pay 10,000 dollars a week and lived well in the civil society.
Can you be a flight attendant even if your sister's height is small? 160 Can you wear sneakers cabinet? I know you have a hand
There is no Australia.
I'm curious what kind of company will let V-log work during business hours.
It's going to be a memory of a lifetime. I'm really excited about it.
Are you working at the minimum hourly wage?
It's so cute at 1:42
What was your dream in school days?
Then do you clean up in Korea? What are you going to Australia?
The shoes and the trench coat are so pretty
No
It's a pity .. I've studied badly in Korea and have an unprofessional job, so I work 14 hours a day and have no personal life at all.

I didn't have a couple.
Those who have been born and lived in Korea will never understand.
WOOOWüò≠üíïyour videos are so aesthetic and satisfyingü•∫‚ùóÔ∏èüëèüèª
Rather, it feels like an insult to those who work hard in those three fields.
My brother is thinking of leaving for Australia. My brother-in-law works in the field of technical jobs in Korea, but Korean companies only care about office work, and they don't literally think about mechanical parts. If they don't have a lot of work, they just cut people, and if they get too much work, they can't handle the existing people. Every time a person changes, it's hard to adjust to, and if you talk about your dissatisfaction, just be patient. The people in the field just literally opened up. This is a cabaret too, but my brother suffers from this a lot and wants to go to Australia where there is no discrimination in his job. In fact, my brother has been working in Australia for more than two years and has always told me that the Australian environment is so good. But even now it's hard. I'm already 31 years old, and I've despaired that I've exhausted my Warhol visa so it's virtually impossible to get to Australia. As a younger brother, I am not happy to see my brother doing it. I'm so sorry. I've worked hard in my own way, and I've been treated like a beggar, but I've been in Korea to immigrate to Australia. Stop the fort and just watch the pawn all day at home, you are dazed. Just lost the reason for life The appearance is itself. My heart is broken ... So I want to ask the creator. What's the way for a 31-year-old man who's already out of warhol visa to go to Australia and get a green card? My brother looked at the technology immigration side, and he said that the conditions are tricky. There are not a few states that require the technical skills you have, and even if you want to go to immigration, you need a college diploma. If you have a hard time with technical immigration right now, is there a way to find out about your chance to get a permanent resident daughter because you've exhausted your Warhol visa? I would be grateful if the producers could reply to you as far as I know ... „Ö†
Good day to see you.
I received $ 11 for an Australian cleaning alba in 1991.

Just watching the video is healing ...> <
I'm envious, but I can't wait to see the guitars around the world.
Cool young friends
Other than that, when I take my daily routine before going to work or after work, that's what hinders me. I want to get bored because women do this.

If you want to do it, you're swearing; If you can't swear in front of Seulgi, don't be ill. If you ask me to take a cell phone at school, you will take pictures too; No, you can do it in a company. Students take pictures everyday at school, but you can also take a cell phone at school. Why don't you do it to them;
I'm surprised!!! Congratulations on leaving! I'll support the second act of my life !!
Tremendous Mimosine

Nice to subscribe ~ ^^
I only envy the subscription 8.2
16 years ago, I really had a lot of school trips. I didn't think there was anybody dancing at the time, but I walked and hid in the shade! The staff did not listen and the clothes were wet. And it's really nice to watch the video. Now I want to be there too. In addition-is it a ringing bell? This video makes you play dozens of times. Long lasting friendship ^^
VLOG, you're really good at making it clean.
I'm so courageous to leave! I think I can do anything well ~

Korea is in a bad mood because of its over time. There is a return to work in a foreign country. You just can't feel good with each other.
It's not wrong,

In the future, I want to live for myself as a subject, not what I really want or do well.
If you look at it like this, there's no doubt that the crew is not only a tough job but also the best job.
I want to see you grow more and more!
I'm not just envious of me because of the problem of income.

The daughter-in-law is a flight attendant.
I have a question. If you're flying to New York for a long time like the video, you're wondering if you're working while you're in New York or resting.
I will tell you the fact. You don't ignore people professionally? It feels like you're a stranger and you can't assimilate into the local community in the first place. Can you clean up and communicate intimately with local white giants and professionals? Absolutely not. Racism is a bonus. Is it economically profitable? In Korea, it's more than 300 if you run a cleaning delivery. No matter how cheap Australia is, it is not cheaper than Korea. The house price? You can't compare the prices of apartments in Seoul, rural and suburban Australia. On equal terms, the cost of living is much lower in Korea. It is true, however, that the level of consciousness in the West is higher than in Korea. On the surface, it's a miscalculation if you think they leave a job and see people as equals.

I've been watching from Facebook 
I learn and sympathize a lot.
I'm going to Everland next week.
I don't have any inconvenience to watch this video, but I don't know why the comments are so hot. I want to live like that. I just thought of this.
While watching the video, I can feel the calmness and silence differently than usual. All my life efforts so far will be beautiful and a good record. In the coming days, the things you have experienced so far will help you shine like precious stones!
The original layered hair is a layered hair !! The layers are formed because the angle is cut, so it gets shorter and shorter as you go up !! If you don't like it, semi-layering will make it shorter.

I was an executive at a famous foreign conglomerate in Seoul, Paris, Singapore, and a year and a half ago I was sick in Singapore. We had a meeting from 9 am to 2-3 am (our head office was calling with Paris New York). I live and die like this. I come to Paris and live with my crying son. It's slow down so I don't get sick anymore. Even if I make much less money, I can afford to live. I saw you from Nayu. Please win and subscribe. Please come to play Paris channel!
Just think of it as self-satisfaction
There is no return in the occupation, but I think there is a return in man. This is certainly true if you look at Koreans who have written down their profession. If I say this to people who are citizens of high consciousness, I will be branded as a racist and it will be hard to live in my life.
I didn't know English 1 but I loved it so much I wanted to sit down and meet a really good homestay mother

I go to work my own way and leave my own way. I work for 2 hours a day and I'm a technical job, but the technical job is the best place to build a building anywhere in the world. If you don't learn technology, you have a lot of technical jobs that you can earn a lot of money without being stressed like going to a big company. I'm a telecommunications engineer. I work really reorganized. I usually do not work in the morning. When I work in the morning, I usually work at 13:00 and usually after 13:00. 4 years as a side job to have fun while leisurely travel while traveling 00 When you come in, you have to make a side job, and you have a harder side job. When you look at Korea, you have a lot of good jobs. Public banks. Some people have over 500 salary.

It's a good job. I'm still cleaning. In 1985, Korea's college graduated salary was about 200,000 won, and when I left, the exchange rate was $ 1,300, so it was $ 200. The couple's cleaning team earned money alone. I earned more money than car mechanics. I had almost no customer complaints. When the one who gave me the first job gave me a job in the morning, it was always better than anyone in the world. I think your car maintenance is not a mechanic but an engineer, so you pay $ 1 a month for a Cadillac dealer. But in the future, you'll have almost nothing to repair.
This cafe blog is so hungry! I always end up so calmly after the video. Amazing and enjoyable video! I love you ~! ‚òÜ ‚ô°

Australian whites are imbued with incomes from industries they don't want to do. If there is anything else, it gives a lot of money and a lot of vacation than Korea „Öã„Öã„Öã Actually, it is a 3D industry that white people do not like to do. If you don't have a job, white people will clean up and cook and do construction work. I'm not going to do the 3D industry which is the field. If somebody has to do it, but they don't do it, they'll have to bring somebody to do it?

If you get a little bit of money from a big company and are just rolled like a part and are not promoted to an executive, is the job you cut when you are late 40 or 50? I went to a big company and left the company now. Seemingly smearing is not a good job. On-time commute, early morning commute, weekend work and stress, so it's a valuable job to get ready for a short time when you are over 40. There are some people who think it's weird. In large corporations, employees, especially white-collar workers, tend to handle parts.
I didn't throw this buzzword to say the right answer or to persuade someone who thought different from me.
Do you offer everything from airlines to hotels or transportation to hotels?
Edit all the fun stuff

The big companies in Korea are doing one thing and giving them a lot of money. Find a job that you can work for a long time
Your job is good and you don't have people. You're trained not to talk uncomfortable, but because of this, you're more likely to change your mind. I prefer white color to blue color. Think about whoever is the most expensive trader in the past and who still ignores them. There is still a slave class.
You need to know how to calculate money
I'm just timid, it's shrinking. I hope you'll be happy to find my job in Korea. If you can go to Australia ~

I think it's a difference in personality and life values. It may be extreme, but even if it's your choice, even if it's hard, stressful, low-paying, and overtime, you can do it. I don't feel that life gets so long as I get older.

At first, when you chose a job, you said that it was important for you to choose a job, but even if you have a good salary in Korea, you chose to do something else. I also worked one day a week off. Sometimes I worked for 10 consecutive days. At that time, I'm a slave or a person. It was hard to make a lot of money back then. Koreans work so hard. Perception should change as soon as possible.
If you envy you say envy, idiots lol
I like this brother

So you're ending your life in Dubai and coming to Korea?
Korea also seems to be going in the same direction as Australia after a while. Now it's a transitional period.
If you look at Qatar Airways or your Emirates friends, you can't last three years.
I've been watching it. It's the last flight ... The video is sad.
Now I'm lingering as an instructor at the Crew Training Institute in Auckland.
How old are the workers? Amusement Park Alba It's funny because I want to do it, but I think it's a little late.

I don't wanna break down like a machine
1. When a friend needs something to drink or something, it's better not to press the button on the crew in the seat, but to come to the bar at the back and ask directly. Sometimes, when you go back, the crew is eating and having a rest. I'm confused as to what's better because I'm actually sitting and calling and waiting or moving around and I don't feel uncomfortable because I want to work less uncomfortable but I wondered what would be better !!
So pretty „Ö†„Ö†„Ö†

Can't you just work in s group? Is cleaning and delivery your goal? It's hard for me to understand the people who go out of the university and go to the factory. It's for the children, but the dog really asks the children what they want. They sell their children to vanity. There's not a lot of S-groups that went before the hourly pay now.
I watched a video
I'm so envious of my work and life
Please take a lot of good videos and upload it in the future ‚ù§
The image is very nice.
Just tae tae! „Öã„Öã „Öã„Öã„Öã „Öã„Öã„Öã „Öã„Öã„Öã „Öã„Öã„Öã
I like your videoüòç
I am an interpreter at a Korean public agency. I came to Australia seven years ago and work for an aged welfare care company. I am best at welfare and usually start at 7:30 am and go home at 4 am. I am married to an Australian man, but my husband leaves work around 4 pm and spends the afternoon and night at home. On weekends, they go to the beach or barbecue to National Park. Not manual labor in Korea but much more satisfying and happy. Husbands also share the household chores and cook alternately. After a while, I plan to buy a caravan with my husband and travel around Australia.
I saw you for the first time today. Last flight. Flower Walk üíù
4:54 Your sister!
Seulgi is always pretty !!
It should be noticed that this is not a dog that is raised in a company, but there is no real answer.
The real cafe vlog is Jihyun's best!
I first saw you today. Are you leaving Korea because of perfume?
Where did you come from?
Congratulations to 1,000 subscribers! Vlog (feat.Mukbang) I'm always watching well lol I'm looking forward to the next video
Oh, Ashana's flight attendants also have pants uniforms!
There are 15 subscribers, but the article is 1,000 true stories.
That was the welcome celebration of Amazon.
me too . .rectal. .4 times. . now. .
But if you eat it like that, don't you hungry? „Ö†„Ö†
One of the most missed places in Korea „Ö† Nice to see you in a long time „Öé„Öé„Öé
What are you using?
Now is the end
Three and a half years ... as a person who raises the dream of airlines .... I feel a sense of weakness ... You see a lot of videos that say that you quit the aviation job like crew .... Of course, their Willing to stop there ... Every time I watch a video like this, is this job extremely hard? I'm starting to think that the dreams of airlines that I have grown up will disappear after only three months of work, and I feel like I've been studying so far.
Is there a litter?
1:27 Oh, I'm pretty „Ö† „Ö†„Ö†„Ö†
I agree I like to subscribe ........
There is no return to the job, but the treatment difference by rank seems big „Öã„Öã Nice to meet you. I work as an offshore plant engineer in Australia.
This video is also the best „Ö†„Ö† „Ö†„Ö†„Ö† „Ö†„Ö†„Ö† üòÇ
It would be better if the background was foreign
Anyone who has achieved his goals correctly will be able to do other things as well. Always support and be happy.
All the drinks looks so delicious ü§§
I think there's hope of having more opportunities.
Are you leaving and doing youtubers?
What happen? Occupation
I was happy to share my good experience.
I love this
I want to be a flight attendant too.
Now
What taste is milk foam?
Now you can get me a job ^^
??? Palgongti If the original ice, the pearl goes into the base ..? We put 3,000 won in pearl .. ????? ying .. ?????? Mojo .. ??
The house is very spacious
Don't worry about me always, but just say you want to do this.
I'll play and eat, let's cut the boss or cut the salary
Wishing you the best, Dayun! With love from Singapore! Waiting to see your next chapter!
I'll ignore the two dogs
Jihyun's video is always like watching the ASMR video! I feel good when I see the sound of ice sticking and sticking to the pot before boiling the pearl. „Ö† ‚ù§Ô∏è Thank you for a good video ‚ù§Ô∏è
I love bubble tea so much !! And that looks very yummy!
May I ask what it tastes like? :-)
Mind admire, this is the way you choose, so keep throwing away the big companies and why not go to Australia, don't worry about your job, just cheer me up. I'm 80 years old. Each one has its own priorities and values, whether it's a hard-worker or hardworker in the corner, there's no superiority in individual behavior and no reason for us to judge.
08:13 Ah nyc ...
Oh, and I want to see the ice in the cup often.
The picture I took with my colleagues at last
If you don't want to live in pain, you have to give one, take a break or make money.
You're so pretty..üíó
If you were in Korea, would you have been able to build a specific plan with the dream of going abroad if you entered SMEs?
I saw it for the first time. I subscribed for one minute because it was annoying to subscribe.
As the space gets longer, small and medium businesses go.
Good Luck‚ù§
When the crew members went abroad, they thought that they would take a rest and stay at the hotel. It's amazing, I like this vlog ~~
If you ask me where is the monthly salary college, I know it's an excuse, but I'm so curious .. I'm just curious.
I miss Australia. Of course, it's hard to make money there. But in Korean society, we just ignore workers, workers, and factory workers. Australia doesn't ignore anything I do. I think it was the best.
Here and there
The content is also useful. Please upload the video frequently.
May I be number one fan
pls update more
Ah jihyun's cafe vlog is the most fun in the world
About 1 million won per month. Cleaning Day 4 hours 5 hours 2 million won a day. 3 million won including other days. Never short of Australian prices. Suddenly, I'm in Wora Valley, Australia! I want to ... Travel around the world in Australia!

Have you been around 6 months? I'm also curious about the age and the Japanese atmosphere
You are wonderful. Discrimination is huge in Japan.
I envy you a lot of money.
I think I watched more Korean programs than when I lived in Korea.
In my life, I felt that the individualistic (?) Social atmosphere was more dominant than the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãGuicheon.
I love your videos a lot!
I have a question, is there a difference between a menu that seals and a menu that you do not?
I really wanna try those bubble teas, they all have such a unique name and flavor
This vlog is over time
I was surprised to scoop up suddenly. I did this. I have been struggling a lot ~ Everything will be fine Dayun :) Cheer!

After watching this video, I'm working hard and I'm going to see you in your room a few years later.
I feel so good
And it's best to do what you like, but if you can't do that, you'd better try to like it.
Wow, is it possible to get up, eat and sleep again ??? I envy you.
It seems like an hourly salary of $ 23 is worth $ 16 to $ 17 in Malvern.
Do you know anyone who has a name from 5:30 seconds?
I think I should tell you .. Where do you live for your personal protection? Even if you do not want to be reflected in the camera.
I'm afraid.
It's Asian ~~ üëèüëèüëèüëè
What is your height?
I waited so much for the video to come „Ö†„Ö† I didn't skip to the end
I watched the video steadily, and it's been a long time. I'm leaving. I'm curious about the reason why you quit.
It's like the contract term ends.
The internal combustion engine isn't going away ...
I'm not kidding. You're pretty.
Can you add the arabic or english sub * please?
Ah hahahaha
Seul-nim What is your usual weight management? Forty-somethings. Do you diet regularly?
If you wake up in the morning and wake up, you have to go to work again.
From vlog images
Both the typeface and the background are sniping „Öã„Öã„Öã „Öã„Öã„Öã
There are a lot of twisted people .. It's ironic. Don't worry about it.
Why are you so pretty?
If you buy it
Traditions and cultural customs that came down to our Korean generation were judges, prosecutors, doctors and omnipotent people. Until the age of our adult gods!
In fact, I'm still not sure what I really want and do well.

I watched it without knowing it was going to video time !!!
I wasn't close to Yongin, why did I rap?
I'll clean it up. Whether you're looking at it or not, Seulgi has been very cute since he was young. While you are trying to live happily, Lee Ye-yong, you are happy „Öã„Öã You know. ·Ü¢ Your self is faithful and passionate about studying.

How old is this sister?
Wow ... I've taken a video in my neighborhood so it's amazing ... I'll come play sometime.
Thank you always ~
It's hard work ..
Life of gratitude and happiness
The reason why money is important is that in Korea, there are so many places that are equally overtime and not working even on weekends.
What's the product you applied to your skin in the video ~~ ???
Please take a picture of your sister !!!!
When I look back at life when I'm about 60 years old, I've lived a good life.
It's a one-person corporate office.
Why are you putting this up? Cleaning really makes a lot of money if you do well in Korea.
Handsome my style
I was elementary school student. I was influenced by my friends ..
The dog is pretty
I have a personal question. Do you have any retirement age as a crew member? Whether domestic or overseas.
That's immigrants. That's why Australian immigration policy is constantly changing. The immigration policy that Australians don't want to take is coming from a young and tax-paying kid from abroad. The Australian immigration policy will never change. Delivering 3D jobs from abroad that centenarians don't want to do. Also called immigration business. Australia is a country that makes money through immigration policy ^^
The Korean feature is that it draws fewer people and forces individual sacrifice.
How much is the pumpkin juice you eat?
Wow .. I saw it for the first time today.
Are you leaving your company?

OMG .you are leaving Emirate. I am glad to watch all your videos. Until then good luck with your new job.Cheer

But I always wondered,

22:56 TWICE Chaeyoung ...?
So pretty
Did you do your eyelash perm ??? I'm curious
I told you when I came to our school before.
I believe there is misery where all life is born. It is life that struggles to overcome it, so I think it is cruel but in a different way happiness comes.
I'm seeing the video for the first time. My sister is so pretty.
New watcher here! Thank you for sharing! Now I want some of these drinks now xD
I watched the video well. I saw something to learn, so I pressed Kudok's super hyo

I mean, I'm envious of the courage to ride a plane for more than 10 hours.
What does it taste like when you eat espresso and soda? First combination!
It's so pretty
I watched the video well. International flight attendants are going to have a hard time. I'll take a rest soon. I'll eat. I can only remember. Even if you're adapted, it's like living a dream. Thanks to this, I got a hair loss shampoo. Next time please show me a lot of pretty faces ^^

The Republic of Korea collected the people's taxes and raised them
You are going to get a green card for maintenance.
There are more full grievances, but all life cannot be without grievances.
Not leaving the contract
It's nice to see you through YouTube ^^
I'm watching my first video now.
Hello, you're working as a law firm? And I like eggs as a whole.
Honestly, pine nuts Korea pine rice Shiru-teok executives are better off earning money than paying the public service tax.
Has anyone else being gong on binge watches of different Cafe Vlogs on Youtube or is it just me? lol these are calming to watch

The day of the crew is amazing! It's an easy job to travel with, but it's a lot more unfamiliar. Have a good look !! Thank you for uploading this video
As I participated in the course, I saw the hardships of the staff with my own eyes, and in the meantime, I was very pleasant! I was in the middle of the program because I didn't have any pleasant memories because of the relationship.
This is Mercy. Do you sit down watching the 23-minute video?
I watched Vlog ~

Many people in their early 30s are in their mid-20s, but they think it would be possible for them to live a life like that ... Two cats and a large house. They think it would be possible to achieve this in their late 20s;
However, how to solve the grievance about life history is a real fun and the biggest homework of life history.
It's always a word that lasts, and I think it's a word that makes people sank ~ I wanted to be a flight attendant, but I had to fold that dream, so I was always disappointed by watching Dayun's video ~ I've struggled and congratulations on leaving again ~ I look forward to seeing you again!
Thanks for inspiring talk! It's the same situation right now. I'm leaving a big company and going to Australia
I'm just tightening it up and the drinks look so delicious üíìüíì

It's not just happiness to win the competition, it's not just happiness, but society and parents are forced to do it. So leaving your environment may be the answer.
I want to be a cat
I like this detailed vlog so much
Even if the woman in the video is a goldsmith, that's not wrong.
i want a job like this!
And I ate at the size up at the store
I returned home from Canberra until 2007 as a cleaning contact. It's nice to meet you. I have a lot of contacts who eat 10 dollars per hour.

Well, as a person who lives in Korea for a lifetime and tries to find happiness here, I've thought about how I would go out, but I think it's too late now ;;;;
I keep watching it and fill it with everything ... Smoothie lid? I was surprised to escape.
For three and a half years, I had a hard time living as a flight attendant in the Emirates !! I will always support you for a happier day ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Some drinks are sealed and every drink has a different lid standard ??
It's hard to have a leisurely life in Korea. Young people are hard at work.
I was so sympathetic, wondering if I had made a custom to rationalize myself who chose to look better than what I like. I cheer for you. Cheer up ~
Can I add pearl to all of Palgongti's drinks?
I waited a long time. What kind of drinks are you sealing and what are you? What is the standard for inserting into ..? !!
It doesn't look like Tapioca Pearl in Lemon Green Tea, but Ji Hyun-chan's favorite menu.

Do you not know that tteokbokki is forbidden when dieting?
From January 2016 to January 2017, I went to Warhol, Australia, and went to a chicken factory and a small factory. I got up early in the morning and finished after 1 or 2 pm. It was my time. I didn't have to try to build specs or study TOEIC like crazy, and I lived with my sister, my brother, who grilled pork belly and StarCraft teammates together. I went to the sea, went to catch crabs, went to skydiving, and it was the best memory of my life.
I saw so much ^^
Oh please upload it to full version
Oh yeah, but the crew left many. Why? It's a personal matter, but ... Is it because flight time or personal time is irregular? The conditions are nice.

I live in Canada, but I still think that if I stop getting a visa, I won't even have a chance to get a visa from other Koreans. It's a personal idea, don't mind. In Canada, because of them, many immigrants don't get a chance. I want to know how. It's so nice to see you!

Will Korea change slowly? Just as the system and citizenship can't change rapidly, we have to move slowly toward the quality of life. In the comments, I think I have a fantasy about Australia comparing Korea to Australia. I have lived abroad, but there are advantages and disadvantages. As a latecomer, Korea needs time. But the answer is that those who are hell in Korea are leaving.
Wow, I'm still nagging. It's going to be hard. I feel like I've only seen Goodnight.
I hope you will face the future as it is now.

I served seven years as a soldier in the US military, right after I was discharged from the Korean army, and the most memorable difference was the way of thinking about people who were similar to what you said. In the Korean military, soldiers and high-ranking people were no different from each other as if they were novices or gods. The most memorable thing was the organization. No matter what class I was, I usually walked through the troops and was able to talk frankly or joke about the problems of the troops. I was very impressed with Colonel's respect as a comparable human being, even when he was dealing with second-rate illness.

The 3rd job of 8 years of small and medium-sized business .. The 1st job leaves the work out at 10 o'clock every day, the 2nd job can't take a day, but the annual fee is freed for the third year. I'm having a hard time because of my boss. No matter where I work, it's a minefield and I'm not really happy. The most difficult thing is the braided culture that divides people up and down and thinks as a means, emotional labor, and noticing culture that makes it impossible to rest when you want to rest. I dreamed of living abroad, but now I'm living in Kuyeokku station to move to a slightly happy job.
It is the life of a livestock that misunderstands that he is a human being.
I'm so envious of the time that I can spend alone with my working time, so it's a good day!
I don't know what I've done with the s group, but it's hard to find an Australian job. You don't understand English and don't get into mainstream so you don't know what it is.

Yes, Samsung production.
But when you're in Korea or in Australia, it doesn't seem to make any difference. I think there's no big difference from imports from Korea, considering the actual price from leaving tax at $ 220,000. Just a leisure. Working environment ... Never compare. And no touch until age 75. This can never be converted into money.

People who are obsessed with the image of others who sees me, and I also have other people's occupations to evaluate them and define their relationships with them. Are there many people who constantly find the other's shortcomings, find their own superiority and live with satisfaction? Probably the origin of the profession comes from such a social atmosphere. Of course, there are no such tribes in Australia. However, if you expose it and ignore others, you can be treated as a barbarian who looks like you're missing, you can't learn, and you're less personal. That's a big difference between Korean and Australian society. Is it the difference between citizenship? In Korea, people sit together and appreciate each other and despise themselves. Therefore, Koreans have a lot of embarrassment when they come to Australia. There are a lot of people who are looking for a Korean mind that 'Guest is king' in Australia and are swearing because of unintentional controversy. Then tell me that I was racist in Korea. Anyway, I'm not interested here. If it's my comfort and my happiness, it's awesome. If you make a lot of money, you have to pay a lot of taxes, but there are some people who work hard and try to get more government subsidies.
It's the best. Really „Ö†„Ö†„Ö† I'll take care of it üòä Handsome! ‚ò∫
