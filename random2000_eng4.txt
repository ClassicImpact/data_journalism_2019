Seulgi is a good subscriber to watch the video! I'm saying that the structure of the house in the video? I don't know until now, but I think you should watch the elevator and the place where you live. ㅠ ㅡ ㅠ I've seen other women's YouTube videos, but I heard that a strange man found a house and stalked it! I didn't know ..
How old are you?
wisdom? Thrash? Garbage!
You didn't fit in the s group and the Australian sweepers are good. Perhaps more people are against it. Some people are in the middle of it. It's inclination. Personality.
I'm so curious to calculate the tip> I really want to go to the raiover quickly as a flight attendant
Can you tell me where the bedding is?
John-I'm close.
You kept your promise ??????
Because I drive
Sister is more than before Yeppo ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
I'm ... a cat !!!
It's my first meeting. I wish you to walk only in the future.
It's so relaxing and comfortable, I'll have hair on my feet.
I have to go to Palgongti tomorrow .. !!! I want to eat it all
I went to Hongdae Palgongti after watching the video, and it was really delicious.
I really don't see it
Take good care of your body and mind and win in other careers
It's really amazing to see it like this
You're so pretty
It is rare to look up and envy the ones who are chasing money like ours.
You worked so hard ~
Uh!
Tolerance is Alba, I watched this video hard ,,? I have to go and work on weekends, It's addictive !!
I quit my 14th year and came to the United States.
I had a bone disease
Directing .. ㅋㅋ
It's sad to see my hat flying at the end.
Dayun, I've been a video viewer since the beginning, and I'm cheering for a new start ~
It's the game song that I played on 5:30 at Jelly King.
Wow, I'm so pretty .... I've been watching celebrity idols. I'm so pretty. I'm a girl but my ideal type. ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ I'm being stimulated I'll live hard from tomorrow, too, I'm so pretty, TT TT TT ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠ TT TT TT
How nice is Korea to live
I was a member of Everland every year until last year, so I went a lot.During the play equipment, I danced happily and made me happy.
Oh, my God
It is really beautiful and cute!
It's rumored that my neighbor's palgongti wears high-end pearls.
I visited today and subscribed. But how do you do the perfect makeup so fast? I envy you ~
I wish you all the blessings of your future.
Yurrrrr Starrrr? ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ At the end of the picture, it looks like you have a lot of good experiences with various people.
Our princess
I watched it for the first time today and I like the truthful and comfortable video ~ I like Jung Ryeo-won, but it looks and feels like it ~ Pretty ^^
It wasn't a big deal in the world ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
I have some questions on the plane!
It's an honor to live in Sokcho
Wow, I feel so good.
Hello, Dayun, we haven't flew together, but I'm going to write you that you have suffered so much. I'll take good care of your health.
Sea salt
Everyone is so cute ㅠㅠ
What are you using for the camera?
This video is a little bit sad ..... ㅠ By this time, my sister went to school while watching the video ㅠㅠㅠ .... I also decided to study English.
I've had 40 years of healing because I'm cleaning up and cleaning up dirty things. I still want to catch white women in and out of the office, but I don't use it in my eyes. When the bell is closed and the bell is pressed, the room is sold and the room is sold at 6 am, the coffee break for the guest, and the guest room is removed by 11 am. There is
You suffered.
I like it ~
11:32 Samsung Pay is the answer!
I'm envious of my house
You have a drink sugar like that. How do you adjust that? The ratio is different, sugar or syrup is added in?
If you're envious, tell me you're envious, don't be sarcastic.
I'm embarrassed that my first encounter is teething.
I love you
I went to Australia in 13 years and had been in a small factory for 2 years, but when I was a year and a half in Kilfrore, I thought I would go to Korea because of physical difficulties. I'm really sympathetic with work and spare sleep. It's been a year and a half since I came to Korea and I miss Australia with fine dust. Please get a green card
I'm a fan of you
This video feels moist! I'm looking forward to the upcoming vlogs!
Ah, and if you are technically interested and interested, why not learn more about heavy machinery than cars?
Is there a lot of people who have applied for so many?
I think it's slime.
I resign in 4/01 and leave on 30th. I'm so tired ~ I hate it so much that I want to kill myself by throwing stress on my family at some point. This is not ... This is not ...
What are you using for the camera? What do you use for editing programs? haha
Congratulation! you gained 1 subscriber !!
I'm going to eat there
I want to think about what else to do elsewhere, so I want to have a different experience before it's too late.
If you come to the Gold Coast if you get a chance, let's shoot together 🙏🏿
I wonder if there is no happy job in Korea.
Fighting
Lol
And basically, Korea is also highly dependent on exports, right? It's hard to eat and live in the domestic market, and even in Japan, it's enough to live in Korea.
It feels like watching a Junior Naver Cafe Tycoon game
4:03 2500 won .. ???????
I'm so pretty that I keep seeing ...
To be honest, I really envy this 'courage'
Are you a military officer ?!
That's amazing. I cheer for you!
Please keep uploading the video of Palgong Tee Vlog.
I saw you for the first time. ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ 😭😭😭😭
Buy inclinations. Use well
I'm a Hong Kong foreigner (like a consumable from a big company ...) I've never been happy working here for over 10 years ... I'm not dealing with people anymore, and I'm not forced to do it for money. , I want to enjoy my life and enjoy life in Australia ... 😭😭 Well, it must be hard to go to Australia ...
Eyelashes in the morning.
Come on, hit the cafe
The Korean president has been working hard for a year, and at that time, he didn't pay 10,000 dollars a week and lived well in the civil society.
Can you be a flight attendant even if your sister's height is small? 160 Can you wear sneakers cabinet? I know you have a hand
There is no Australia.
I'm curious what kind of company will let V-log work during business hours.
It's going to be a memory of a lifetime. I'm really excited about it.
Are you working at the minimum hourly wage?
It's so cute at 1:42
What was your dream in school days?
Then do you clean up in Korea? What are you going to Australia?
The shoes and the trench coat are so pretty
No
It's a pity .. I've studied badly in Korea and have an unprofessional job, so I work 14 hours a day and have no personal life at all.
When the egg is boiled and uncooked, you don't know it and the white sticks together
Are you public?
^^ Satisfaction
Private shopping mall
sister!!!!!!!!
1. The day I broke up with my first girlfriend.
It's your power and you live with the money you earned.
My face is grinding ...
For cat cater like my house
Not many young people pursue my true freedom and happiness. But it's nice to see Inchoi who lives a quality life after a long time. It's good.
8:25 8:25 8:25
I didn't have a couple.
Those who have been born and lived in Korea will never understand.
WOOOW😭💕your videos are so aesthetic and satisfying🥺❗️👏🏻
Rather, it feels like an insult to those who work hard in those three fields.
My brother is thinking of leaving for Australia. My brother-in-law works in the field of technical jobs in Korea, but Korean companies only care about office work, and they don't literally think about mechanical parts. If they don't have a lot of work, they just cut people, and if they get too much work, they can't handle the existing people. Every time a person changes, it's hard to adjust to, and if you talk about your dissatisfaction, just be patient. The people in the field just literally opened up. This is a cabaret too, but my brother suffers from this a lot and wants to go to Australia where there is no discrimination in his job. In fact, my brother has been working in Australia for more than two years and has always told me that the Australian environment is so good. But even now it's hard. I'm already 31 years old, and I've despaired that I've exhausted my Warhol visa so it's virtually impossible to get to Australia. As a younger brother, I am not happy to see my brother doing it. I'm so sorry. I've worked hard in my own way, and I've been treated like a beggar, but I've been in Korea to immigrate to Australia. Stop the fort and just watch the pawn all day at home, you are dazed. Just lost the reason for life The appearance is itself. My heart is broken ... So I want to ask the creator. What's the way for a 31-year-old man who's already out of warhol visa to go to Australia and get a green card? My brother looked at the technology immigration side, and he said that the conditions are tricky. There are not a few states that require the technical skills you have, and even if you want to go to immigration, you need a college diploma. If you have a hard time with technical immigration right now, is there a way to find out about your chance to get a permanent resident daughter because you've exhausted your Warhol visa? I would be grateful if the producers could reply to you as far as I know ... ㅠ
Good day to see you.
I received $ 11 for an Australian cleaning alba in 1991.
I'm looking at this
You shouldn't do it all the time. . .....
Can't I add 2 pearls to a smoothie?
I'll regret it (Besides, I'm working 52 hours in Korea now
I have to live ... I'm 20 years old.
Tteokbokki hon ...
The thumbnails are so pretty, I feel like I'm going to heal .. The house is also tidy and I'm so pretty. I haven't passed the second, I saw it until the end I'm so attracted Imari
I'm going to watch Vlog.
This is him.
Dayun's Magbang video suddenly reminded me of my nephew
Show me a lot of pretty faces, sister
Korea is a reorganized place with a lot of money.
It's not that hard to live like this
Why are you sad?
05:31 Isn't it the maple song?
Can you tell me the name of the cafe?
Just watching the video is healing ...> <
I'm envious, but I can't wait to see the guitars around the world.
Cool young friends
Other than that, when I take my daily routine before going to work or after work, that's what hinders me. I want to get bored because women do this.
Am i the first Taiwanese here ~? hahaha. the shop is from Kaohsiung City (south of Taiwan), and happy to see another delicious drink brand opening in Korea.
Reason for subscription. I also joined the company in 2005. -Retired in 2012. And the carpenter wanted to go
This is Amazon's PS from T. Express.
What kind of cat is it over ?? Please let me know ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
Seulgi is so cute
Here's your video.
Empathy cool
I'm from Thailand. Why do you resign from the Emirates Airlines? I follow you forever I don't know Korean. But I watched the video because it was interesting and it's my experience But I like to watch because it is a job that I dreamed of Because I want to work with Emirates Airlines.
I've never eaten 80 tea, but if I have 0 sugar in milk tea, I don't get sugar 1 at all ?!
I am a human being in Goheung today.
I'm a big fan of Pyeonmusong and Amazon's Captain. Can you upload your dancing together? I was very impressed when I danced on the Amazon at T.X.
Please apply your lips soon .......... please .......
So, I want coffee
It allows you to meet your colleagues, friends, seniors, and juniors.
At the end of the video I'm eating together too ... 😢 It's been a lot of work! Hope you are happy wherever you are!
What's the Amazon video?
I watched my first video today. Last flight ... I can feel something frightening! I look forward to running further. Subscribe forward! good! I will join Dayun Fighting!
You will succeed.
I didn't have X to go
300,000 won per week
Do you live in Gangwon-do?
My mom is also a flight attendant ~
8:27 What happens to the remaining drinks .. ㅠㅠ Delicious ㅠㅠ
Hi.
I don't know what the charm is but I'm attracted to it.
damn id go to this cafe daily if i didnt live in america
It's my dream job ... I'm traveling abroad while working.
I've been binged watching your videos for the last 2 days. I've watched other's cafe vlog too but you are my favorite 💕✨.
I love your videos! so relaxing ❤️
It's wet ~ It's wet ~ It's all wet ~
Arere moe yong? (I just wondered the naming)
I want to know the name of the shampoo
This is what I saw when I went to New York
I do n’t even like coffee but this video is so relaxing !! 😍
If you want to do it, you're swearing; If you can't swear in front of Seulgi, don't be ill. If you ask me to take a cell phone at school, you will take pictures too; No, you can do it in a company. Students take pictures everyday at school, but you can also take a cell phone at school. Why don't you do it to them;
I'm surprised!!! Congratulations on leaving! I'll support the second act of my life !!
Tremendous Mimosine
I remember when I went to New York.
Fighting!
Look at your dog as soon as you wake up.
I want to live like a sister when I grow up. ㅠㅠ Peaceful and quiet work. ㅠㅠ In the morning, I play with a cat and live alone.
I went to Bag Pal Gong Tee and it was so delicious.
Sister hair loss shampoo effect good ??
So free company ...
Hull .... Wannabe life .... When I grow up, I just want to live (?)
How tall are you!?
I'm going to have fun today too ♡♡
As I was deeply worried about my life, I saw a video and wondered about my age.
I haven't lived a lot yet, and after a few years I have found that racism is severe.
Why did your hair change suddenly when you leave work?
Nice to subscribe ~ ^^
I only envy the subscription 8.2
16 years ago, I really had a lot of school trips. I didn't think there was anybody dancing at the time, but I walked and hid in the shade! The staff did not listen and the clothes were wet. And it's really nice to watch the video. Now I want to be there too. In addition-is it a ringing bell? This video makes you play dozens of times. Long lasting friendship ^^
VLOG, you're really good at making it clean.
I'm so courageous to leave! I think I can do anything well ~
I will only walk in the flower road ^^
Please tell me about your eyelashes.
I'll subscribe
cute
Are you Burberry Coat Odyssey?
Would you recommend the menu Alba!
Teacher! It's me. I'm Charin. I subscribed.
But the cafe is very cheap! I go to Gong 3 times a week but I hear money.
Some mouse information!
Too much ice in humans
I will support you more today! 👍
But it would be hard to keep doing it.
fighting
I saw you.
I want to live like this sister when I'm a real adult. Car, cat, slime, home, work, boyfriend, pretty ... my romance ㅠㅠ
https://youtu.be/yo3whM3Jn8A
I want to send slime to Seulgi
Please try again next time ~ ♡♡
I hate when people put the straw for the costumer
ㅋㅋㅋ I'm in my neighborhood, so I'm going to go often
Where did you think you got it?
Flax religion from Helberland
salam dari Indonesia ~
The cats are so cute
Are you going in the country? It doesn't just treat you as a job.
I've been watching the flight layover of Dayun, but I'm sorry that I haven't seen it now.
Ooh .. it all tastes good.
Keep on posting your daily life vlog ...
What do you do when you work for your company?
I think I'm a big company, a minimal doctor, a public corporation, or an asshole.
Too little lunch
Is it spoon?
I would live a life without regrets
Can you tell me what the camera name is?
I'm sorry, you'll find a good way.
Replying to @David_Wolf
Heberber ... I haven't had bubble tea so long, I really wanted to eat it. I really want to eat .. And Jihyun's so pretty and cute !! Especially the subtitles again !! It's so pretty

Origin of Espresso It's customary in Italy, and it's customary to rinse your mouth before you take a shot, so you can feel the flavor and taste of the shot better.
It was my first flight today!
New York is a food room ^^
Why is there no ice in the green tea?
I watched this video more than 5 times because I was really addicted
It's so pretty, I'm surprised when I see you, I'm surprised ,,,,,,
I really want to be a alba café after the SAT, should I get a barista certificate .., And, a lot of customers are difficult to respond ...?! I'm mentally weak, but the cook is broken ...?
All the coffees are delicious 😋😋😋😋
Wedding;)
I've been working as an engineer for a heavy equipment company for over 20 years, and it's really different in Pay and Benebit than in car technology.
Thank you so much. I'll cheer you up for all the upcoming new things 🙏🏻 💞
You're really pretty ㅠㅠ Always looking good ㅠㅠㅠ ♡
Are you paying taxes? It's illegal for a cash job, but Australian slaves are taking unfair profits by renting a car, but be careful not to take pictures of such illegal activities without any hesitation.
Wow !! 💙💙
My sister is the best ❤ My sister has become my hobby
Always look like you are ...
I don't know much about the country yet. It's a bigger city, like Korea's Cheongdam.
Lip-Peripera Deep Throat
I take the eggs at the corners and then roll them with my palms
Is there a sealing beverage or a lid-covered beverage?
I don't know our two daughters who are native
I don't want to see how to make coffee with a alba cafe, but I don't like to watch coffee but I'm so addicted to this video I subscribe to it and turn it all the time ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Drug video $ _ <Thank you for uploading a good video ~! ~! Alba for strength ~! ~!
My wrist hurts a lot when I'm pulsal. I'm going to rub it hard, but I'm just going to cut it. But when I think about the shooting and editing efforts, it's too painful to watch.
I'm working for a large group L. I'm doing a job I love so much. I'm hit by people.
Dahyun! You're so cute and these videos are wonderful. Thank you for taking us on little journeys with you. I will stay subscribed and I hope whatever you're doing next will be a blessing for you!
The only one of the YouTube blogs, watch all the videos! If you're watching, it's like a friend and it's so relaxing and soothing. You don't have to lose your mind and keep this video.
Pretty ~ ^^
A complete overview .... contributor ❤️
It's so healed, but it's so healing ... ㅠㅠㅠ When the lid is closed, it's too tight.
I have a lot of makeup
Five
It's really nice to see the video neatly ^-^ b
It's delicious to eat carbonated espresso ~~ !! Blonde espresso tonic on the buck 👍🏻👍🏻
The crew is also fresh Ashana
I'm glad to see you again
I want to know what it's like to do it ...
I also went to a large trading company in Korea and the salary was fine compared to Dong Nai, but I wasn't happy. However, my sister immigrated to Australia and lived here.
I think I want to live with two cats
Cats over cute
I really want to live like that ... It's so pretty
No lens in the morning !!! ??
It's my first time, but I'm leaving.
Many times larger than the gratitude and pleasure I received
WOW ...
I have to press subscribe
Yeah, I regret it old ~
I also want to start a café part-time job and keep on preparing for the crew !!
Phobia
What do you feel like being watched for yourself?
I enjoyed watching this video thank you🙆🏽‍♀️💕💕
You are beautiful.
Seulgi ㅠㅠ
your videos make me feel soooo good .........
Dayoon 😭 I just watched a video of my Dubai family friends leaving. What is this !!!!!
Even if I go to work, I can't fix the entangled minds and culture that are stuck in the managers of 4-60s or higher.
omg as a fellow crew member, i know how it feels when you're no longer wearing your wings! I'm trying my best to continue another chapter in my life too but even until now, it's hard for me think that how hard I'm gonna miss flying and all those beautiful layovers, with all those crazy rosters every month. I wish u good luck in your next chapter! The last part made me tear up knowing that my time will come too soon!
Can I have YouTube on Asiana?
Grain ice cream ... hahaha .. You are a fan ㅠㅠ
To give the espresso with carbonated water, rinse your mouth with carbonated water to feel the taste of the espresso ~
I live so well
Whole food market
Since you are a Korean restaurant in Korea
Excuse me, but how old are you? 😝
The lens is awesome, please, please?
Can I get some trench coat information ???
You're so pretty. ㅠㅠㅠ Did you curl your hair later?
4:02 Wow. It's a real price for drinks. I've never been to Palgong Tea, but I'd like to go there.
If you have a wish, I'd like to meet you.
I think it's really awesome to have good memories with people in a certain place.
Not just Albas but that attraction
what am i doing here? when i have bunch of works to do. but this video is aestheticly pleasing
Then turn it around
Whyy I cryinnn lolll
I'm so cute, cute and pretty, and I'm too pretty ㅠㅠㅠ Black I want to be Rio I want to be cute ㅠㅠㅠ
Do you know where your hair strap is? I love Cookie Monster but I want to save it
Oh my god
Are you the boss in the cafe or only worker？
awesome
Women's hairpins are always wonderful
No, Siebel, whoever it is, no matter what you do, you've got a bunch of embryos, and you've fallen in love. If you're like that, you try and live like that. Their parents are trying hard to lose their bones so they can make money and live their children comfortably. Should you have a hard time if you live hard? You try harder This is social
My sister is so pretty and so cute, her pretty face, her voice is pretty, and she really misses you once .. ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ I love you, ,, 😻
Rio and Mumu are very cute ~
It's almost like Korea in Australia.
Pretty
Asiana Flight Attendant Skirt Regulations Can I Wear Pants? It's amazing that it only implicitly defines skirts.
0:32
Sister where do you work .. you give me so much..❤️❤️
 Does your leg hurt a lot?
He will be healed by the video of Lehren 💙 Lehrein I have a question I wonder .. If you graduate from the bank credit system or cyber can also be a flight attendant .. ?? !! Would it be hard?
I think it's snow white.
Steamed babe
Increasingly, the population decreases, the competitiveness is lost, and the society becomes sick as the fish in the sushi restaurant dries.
Resemble resin
Hope u do well after this! I ’m really enjoyed watching all of your videoss ❤️❤️❤️❤️ btw i ’m your fans from malaysia 🌹🌹
Korea is in a bad mood because of its over time. There is a return to work in a foreign country. You just can't feel good with each other.
It's not wrong,
Why you're not working morning to evening?
So I live as a production worker.
People who can't go to see me look like Dayun
After working hard, I want to work in a cafe.
Where can I buy ampoules?
.. youtube
I work 15 hours a day in South Korea, and most of the self-employed are not able to pay their own labor costs.
Have a nice life
What is your occupation? People live first. Those who have seen the end of stress know what I mean.
Palgongti often goes
I think it's fun to have fun ㅎㅎㅎ ㅎㅎㅎ
love watching these eventho we know the danger of consuming all these sugar and carbs kkkk
It's mascara and no burr.
I watched the video because I recommended it. I saw a lot of people because I watched other videos. I will go there a lot !!
I'm going to Australia to earn 400 a month
It's cool> <ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
And Masitgeta
It wasn't all sealing.
I hope the ties and memories there are forever ~
Tteokbokki is not fat.
It's a temple, but my boss's force. Real workers don't do that
Did you curl your hair? I'm looking for a perm because I want to have a hair like you. Can you tell me what the perm is? 🙏🏿❓ 😭 ♥ ️
In Korea, at least the return is decided by the level of earning.
I was so pretty in the morning. I was black and bumpy.
One of the visitors to the hotel in Milan, a child enters and jumps while stepping on the rabbit ears, one of them is dead ..
헉 무 송 When I went 2 years ago, it was fun and I only took Amazon Express more than 10 times that day and took pictures with Musong. But I don't remember it. Wow !!
I got up but I'm wearing the lens lol What happened?
ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ It's an old video, but there are a lot of twisted people. 켜 Turn on the camera and leave it for a few minutes. Not getting down
Be good at anything
It's so pretty
Do you have Sunmin yet?
Are you alone?
I also ride a lot of EK on a business trip to Dubai. You may read this, but keep it healthy :)
apa cuma saya yang dari indonesia?
헉 ... You look like Suzy🖒
D. If you're a king, it would be better if you worked in an immigrant house.
What lens information did you see in this video !!!!! ❗️❤️
Always supportive !!!
I saw Australia I miss you ^^
Matcha milk tea is so delicious 🌿
Omg I wish I could have seen you since I went on the plane so much this Month😔
So pretty sister ,, ❣️
Dunn needs it. Feeling. Lol
you must be so exhausted don't forget to rest
Palgongti Alba is so good!
I'm so handsome because I use a mask
I'm a 257th subscriber
Why don't you join the podcast “The Real Talk of Heavenly Women” talking about the crew ?!
Everyone knows when to die.
It's really fresh
Isn't Australia a racist country? For reference, I traveled to Sydney in January, and it's a very multiracial community, and it's not bad for the Chinese. What about the rest of the world?
Why is my favorite mango bubble tea?
Ooh. cool. looks good.
The most talked to friends around 2019.
Goddess Dot!
It's so exciting to get on a plane! I also traveled to Japan and landed in Gimpo. I went down to the clouds, but I couldn't see it and shake it.
Insta, ID what?
What should I do
In the future, I want to live for myself as a subject, not what I really want or do well.
If you look at it like this, there's no doubt that the crew is not only a tough job but also the best job.
I want to see you grow more and more!
I'm not just envious of me because of the problem of income.
I'm leaving my job.
Do you know what you are doing with the extras you created? Do you usually throw away or drink? I'm curious! ~ ^^ And I watched my sister's video so well ~
  ㅎㅎ You are cool. I think too, but ㅋㅋ By practice ㄷㄷㄷ ㄷㄷㄷ
It looks so yummy and delicious ㅠㅠ I saw it well today !!
I like cabin more than slimy cockpit! haha
M What about my good times when I'm sick?
I have a hard time
I don't know well, but is it different from Palgongti?
I like it because the other place is too sweet pearl and can not control the sugar content that is not good ~ ㅎㅎ Palgongti is more fresh than other third-party pearl, but it seems to me good!
I think I'll come back a lot in the future.
What is the eyeliner for? !!! ???
I'm so sad
I don't know why costumers buy a cold drink while is raining 😂😂😂? 😂
I'm so pretty.
It will be a gentle amount of scab and spiral.
If I don't have the courage anymore this year, I think I'll just live as I do again.
The cabin crew was from 97 to 2002. At that time, the fly time was about 180 hours a month, but now I don't know if it complies with the frms recommended by icao.
The video for the boss ㅋㅋ
I'm watching the feed and I'm subscribed to it
Chop the chocolate!
I feel so sad😔. Like whyyy?
Stay alert and continue your normal career before it's too late
I'm diligent in Korea, so I'm diligent.
Is it just me?
Does layover mean crew means to transfer?
US cleaners are scared of salary
It's a low world tension
It's a healthy youth ~
If you change it to a single shot, it will look pretty !!!
Yes
It will help you .. ^^
I think it's one of the enviable jobs.
Don't forget seven days a week
I really like to watch your videos but i ca n’t understand what you ’re talking about, wishing you ’ll be willing to add english sub later on your next videos. Thank you💕 xoxo
It's the first time I'm watching the video and it's pretty ㅎㅎ As a premature student I hope to get a job ㅠㅅㅠ .... I'll come back often !!
Seulgi Nyan is so cute> <
The accent is similar to me.
Subscribed ^^
I feel like we were in New York together !! Lere Nim
It's a great place to work, but I always support people who work here.
Is this a true story?
Congratulations to Youtube
I love you too.
5:53 exo! Woow, i love your videos and I love you too! I love this channel ♥ ️
I came to Korea.
The monthly rent is 20,000 won per hour.
Is it delicious milk tea?
This is the first time I'm so pretty ..... Oh, I'm so beautiful .... I'm the first person to be so neat and pretty .............
Everland these guys must be full-time job unconditional ^^
Ah ... you are so pretty? ♡♡♡♡♡
I will support you.
Jimin What kind of camera do you use? I wondered if the color felt so beautiful because of the cafe lighting .. !!
If you look back later ...
I ’m so obsessed with this
Have you ever wondered how hair can be like that ... !!!!

Hey, why are you laughing? ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㄱㅋ ㄱㅋ ㄱㅋ ㄱㅋ ㄱㅋㅋㅋ
I wanna be with you wherever it would be.
Wow ... houses are amazing !! Sincere and fun! Awesome! ^^
I watched Vlog ~~ What kind of camera do you use for 20 minutes?
Too happy
It looks like Go Jun-hee
Resembles Resin.
Somehow, Dayun will work again as a career in Dan Air later ㅎㅎ
I'm so pretty that I won't be able to see you in the future ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅋㅠ
The daughter-in-law is a flight attendant.
I have a question. If you're flying to New York for a long time like the video, you're wondering if you're working while you're in New York or resting.
I will tell you the fact. You don't ignore people professionally? It feels like you're a stranger and you can't assimilate into the local community in the first place. Can you clean up and communicate intimately with local white giants and professionals? Absolutely not. Racism is a bonus. Is it economically profitable? In Korea, it's more than 300 if you run a cleaning delivery. No matter how cheap Australia is, it is not cheaper than Korea. The house price? You can't compare the prices of apartments in Seoul, rural and suburban Australia. On equal terms, the cost of living is much lower in Korea. It is true, however, that the level of consciousness in the West is higher than in Korea. On the surface, it's a miscalculation if you think they leave a job and see people as equals.
Kangaroo meat factory, cleaning, hard work
OmG tempo as well !! I would love to come to your cafe !!! EXO as expected. Vocal kings.
I watched everything for 10 minutes today
Have you ever worked with white palgongti? I'll go live Daegu !!
I've been waiting I'll see you today 🥰❤️
It's really cool to go to show-up
I've been giving up in Warhol in the middle of the 20's and I've been working for less than a month, but after earning money, I'm making nothing.
Wow?
I don't feel uncomfortable if I don't tie my hair .... or the video?
I'm sad because it reminds me of my last flight. Welcome back to Korea!> <
All my friends who worked with me were permanent residents and lived in Australia.
Where can I buy an aroma spray?
Oh, I'm seeing you here. ㅠㅠㅠ I just saw it and knew it! ̆̈!
The cat is totally aimed at the world envy.
The last piece of music isn't in the sound source? TT
Do you sleep with Seulgi's hair at night? I envy you because you look very relaxed in the morning.
But it was so sweet that I drank a fifth of it and ate ramen at a convenience store with my friends.
I'm your eternal fan- ♡♡
Did you have a hard time !!!! I'll cheer for a new start !!! Just walk on the flower road ~ ^^
It's scary these days (man)
The fierce and lonely competition for joining the company and the snowball fight with the tedious keyboard and monitor are memories of a time and youth.
Do you know your bedding information?
Ahying!
I ’m getting trained to work here! Lol would love to work here 💕
When you were young
Is this cafe your own ??
If you live hard with whatever you do, it doesn't matter where you are.
Always be happy
I wonder if there is a country that is worse than Korea. .
It's nice to be home.
I'm still a high school student but I'm Asiana.
I hope you will settle down and succeed.
😢😢😢
You're in Kyungsan, it's amazing because it's so close
Did you ever hang that ??? Where can I buy a bag with Burberry coat ~~ ???
I'll look forward to the next video ^^
I thought it was 23 hours because it was 24 hours
I have been working in Korea and I am in Warhol, Australia. Looking at what you said, I look back at the reason for coming back to Warhol. I'll come and watch the video sometimes. Fighting ~
I've been watching from Facebook 
I learn and sympathize a lot.
I'm going to Everland next week.
I don't have any inconvenience to watch this video, but I don't know why the comments are so hot. I want to live like that. I just thought of this.
While watching the video, I can feel the calmness and silence differently than usual. All my life efforts so far will be beautiful and a good record. In the coming days, the things you have experienced so far will help you shine like precious stones!
The original layered hair is a layered hair !! The layers are formed because the angle is cut, so it gets shorter and shorter as you go up !! If you don't like it, semi-layering will make it shorter.
So cute
7:45 + orange peel
I was an executive at a famous foreign conglomerate in Seoul, Paris, Singapore, and a year and a half ago I was sick in Singapore. We had a meeting from 9 am to 2-3 am (our head office was calling with Paris New York). I live and die like this. I come to Paris and live with my crying son. It's slow down so I don't get sick anymore. Even if I make much less money, I can afford to live. I saw you from Nayu. Please win and subscribe. Please come to play Paris channel!
Just think of it as self-satisfaction
There is no return in the occupation, but I think there is a return in man. This is certainly true if you look at Koreans who have written down their profession. If I say this to people who are citizens of high consciousness, I will be branded as a racist and it will be hard to live in my life.
I didn't know English 1 but I loved it so much I wanted to sit down and meet a really good homestay mother
I saw you editing for a while. Are you editing with iMovie? The video looks so good, so I'm going to ask you once.
Cool!
Every single video is so beautiful
Oh ㅋㅋㅋ ㅠㅠㅠ I'll live my life Oh !! I want to go to see you
8:38 My sister's eyes are so pretty ❤
I'm 29 years old Poland USA China Hungary and so on.
At 31, I lived a short life, but personally
I'm excited, it's fun, twice
I am a foreign company in Korea. I moved to the Australian branch through an internal transfer and I got a green card.
Can you tell me the camera model? ㅠㅠ It looks light and looks good!
Cool,, ♡
Where do you go to work?
It's 1 minute and 50 seconds wet ~ It's a good voice for Everland.
It has been pleasure to share your journey through the Emirates. All the best wishes to your future endeavour. I am looking forward to Vlog in your daily life. From Melbourne
Lol lol
I go to work my own way and leave my own way. I work for 2 hours a day and I'm a technical job, but the technical job is the best place to build a building anywhere in the world. If you don't learn technology, you have a lot of technical jobs that you can earn a lot of money without being stressed like going to a big company. I'm a telecommunications engineer. I work really reorganized. I usually do not work in the morning. When I work in the morning, I usually work at 13:00 and usually after 13:00. 4 years as a side job to have fun while leisurely travel while traveling 00 When you come in, you have to make a side job, and you have a harder side job. When you look at Korea, you have a lot of good jobs. Public banks. Some people have over 500 salary.
Wow I didn't realize how much milk is used in lattes. Good thing i never order them
Keep up the hard work👍👍
You speak well!
Good job for you! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I saw you when you went to Alba.
Congratulations on exceeding 1,000 subscribers ~ I am so sad and depressed that I will return to my daily life after getting off the plane back to Incheon. I didn't like the way of getting out. ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
헉 ... I'm going to travel toiletries shampoo, foam, body wash, soap ... the end!
Thank you ^^
Thank you :)
I'm Holicin 'in the cooking video of Lerenim! I'm always watching very well. New York video was so fun ~ ^^
Are you going to live alone?
Thank you so much
Salary ㄿ ㄿ
Wealthy nations also easily dig up resources and sell them in the English-speaking world. If Australia is a true home country, even if it's single ethnic or English, it's as perfect as Korean. Wu Heljoin age caste handcuff slavery
I will support all things in the future!
I don't have any dust in my house. I think it's better to buy it.
12:55 What's your bag? So pretty!!
Really ... I love you ...
The crew dress looks great. Oh, of course, you look beautiful.

 I'm worried about finding a blue collar job, but in the end, why don't I just be happy with myself?
I think it's a crazy concept
Hotel room service was delicious. It's just a hotel. I've been to more than a hundred hotels around the world for a profession,
Come on! You are great and envious
After you get a green card, please succeed.
Look happy, I want to imitate!
It's amazing how you do your hair
LOL What is this work?
Watching your videos makes me miss working at my old job
I can only hear one direction song from Blue Bottle.
I could watch you do that all day
This video was very hard and I always take good care of food and think about health first and upload the video I'm so pretty and pretty and pretty
It's so cute how you loved the owner of Tiganane for raising a cat with love ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠㅜ ㅜㅠㅠㅠ
I'm going to eat ice latte with pearl
Ah, you're gone
Your skin is so nice
I like you .. Just the vlog atmosphere .. No, it's just good.
I can't wait to see that romance.
Replying to @David_Wolf
At the end, you look at the polaroid photos and edit them.
I was not famous when I was riding,
Real palgongti seems to have a lot of volume
I miss you all ...
Oh my god..👍👍 Video so cute !! 😍😍
I ... I saw you for the first time today. Thank you
I watched my sister's video and sulked me too! Thank you so much for that time ~~ ❤️👍 I want to do everything Haseyong ~ I will cheer anything :) Oh and my sister today too
In Korea, there are no jobs, and in Western countries, there are no jobs, and human beings are precious.
It's so fun! Hide and seek .. Fun! My grandfather is working as a staff and I'm shooting hide and seek! But I can't see it well ..
I'm a graduate of aviation ~ I'm more curious than the video!
I guess its time for u to settle down n start ur own family😜😜😜
Hello, this is PR Agency PRGATE.

Korea is gradually losing their jobs. I think Korea can work happily enough to make up your mind.
Crush all the egg shells at once and make it easier
Sister ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Sindeokteokbokki when you eat mobile phone holder ?? Where are you going ...?
If I had been studying abroad for 10 years, not my Warhol, my parents would have spawned me at home ... I didn't live up to my expectations.
Is the juice delicious? I have to adjust my diet so I have to eat lightly but the pumpkin juice looks so good !!

I hope to be closer to the happiness you want ~

Good night!

Do you have any idea about welding around?
Then I meet my wife .. 20 years of marriage ... still coming from the road to see my heart jumps .. I feel like I've been out of here and living freely like a bohemian. So my friend or me ... the stickiness that you have built up is not your usual stickiness.

IU also gateumyeonseo gateumyeonseo Anyway Yoona also nice look ㅎㅎ
I am happy to take care of the people around me, not going to South Korea or the US or Australia. Instead, do not harm others. If you stop boasting through SNS and start not envying others, you already seem half successful.
I want to eat lemon green tea so much ... 😳
Vlog is so funny ..
I've never eaten it.
I'm envious of driving well. TT TT when I was 20 years old, I don't have a car, so I went to a car-related company.
Dayun's future will be happy to support you💕💕 Thank you ^^
If they don't do that, they're gonna die, they'll study, doctors, lawyers.
If you wipe it hard when you are young, the end of the year is good. The kids have a good future, they don't care about their old age. I was sad and tired at first
What is the first place in the video because it's white? It wasn't Daegu Daegu Palgongti or Hayang Palgongti, so it's Gingaminga. I'm watching the video. You're fighting.
Come and play ~ Press 3 kinds! :) :) 👍
I've worked so hard every time I watched and enjoyed the videos that I always challenged. I'm looking forward to life in the future.
My Jihyun 꿍 ~~~ 💗❤️💗
I'm the only one who came to me
Spanish?
It's fun for the first time, so I hit the subscribe bar ㅎㅎ Always fight!
Have fun! Hehe
I wanted to see the title of the title next to youtuber.
It's so pretty like Suzy ..
I'm really envious of my dream life ㅠㅠ I envy you and I'm so pretty ㅠㅠ Always watching the video ❤️❤️
Seulgi is so pretty. How can I have such a face.
Thank you for today's class
I went to a foreign financial company a few years ago and hit the banking industry because it was so dirty.
Thank you so much Vlogo ~ ♥ ️ ♥ ️ ♥ ️ Can you tell me your English grade ?? Curious about how much you talked!
I want to be an adult like Seulgi ... I respect you ㅠㅠ
Rio, you're so cute.
And it's important to meet a lot of people. You said that you don't like working with many people.
If you put on Popo Cream on your face
I've been thinking about bubble tea for 10 minutes but I'm really funny ㅠㅠ I want to be alba in the bubble tea shop ㅠㅠ
Yes, Yun-juku disappeared ...
I see Dayun for the first time in this video
Why are you doing it without ice?
Can you tell me the camera and editing information?
Other airlines go to the end, but Asiana can't cross the wall twice.
I think it's always full when you make a drink ... (I like it so much ... 🙋‍♀️💓💓)
Young people! Even if you enjoy your youth without taking a day off, it's that time when you look back. . Enjoy until you get tired.
If you don't want to thank Pyongyang, stop.
Wow, I didn't know that there was so much dust in bedding.
Are you applying popo cream on your face?
I'm a milk teacher looking at Palgong Tee Vlog. I've been to Palgong Tea for the first time.
Layover vlog, the old thoughts are coming and going I'm living a second life as a crew of other airlines-the end is another beginning.
Can I ask what kind of camera you use?
Because of that.
Love it!!!!!!!!
Feeling a bit melancholic while watching this video. Even though I am only a new subscriber, but I have watched a few of your GRWM flight attendant vlog series and the BGM accompanying this theme of this video can really influence one's mood. I wish you all the best in your future <3!
Shading-Too cool for school
Finally, Nyan's chewing on her fingers
It's really fun
Thank you
That's when I went to Instagram Live!
쬬
I want you to stack it like a mountain
I think it's because I lived in Australia.
I was really surprised when we came out at the end of the day 욬 ㅋㅋㅋ I'm always watching the video 〰️🙌
What company do you go to?
I've been waiting for it. Of all the cafe vlogs, it's the most fun to Jihyun 꿍 ㅠㅠ ❤️
It's a good job. I'm still cleaning. In 1985, Korea's college graduated salary was about 200,000 won, and when I left, the exchange rate was $ 1,300, so it was $ 200. The couple's cleaning team earned money alone. I earned more money than car mechanics. I had almost no customer complaints. When the one who gave me the first job gave me a job in the morning, it was always better than anyone in the world. I think your car maintenance is not a mechanic but an engineer, so you pay $ 1 a month for a Cadillac dealer. But in the future, you'll have almost nothing to repair.
This cafe blog is so hungry! I always end up so calmly after the video. Amazing and enjoyable video! I love you ~! ☆ ♡
Are the crew all pretty?
New York edition of Lehre by VLOG critic Abraham Moon
In Korea, I believe that 20 years and 30 years later, when the young people become mainstream of society, there will be a time when there will be no change and no chance of working.

Do I have to have a license to do Cafe Alba? How do I get it?
There is no chocolate foam in my neighborhood.
The first bus ride scene in front of you
I didn't know it would be the last day of my last flight, so I had a schedule. When I watched this video, I remember it when I was in the middle of the last minute :( I also had a hair and make-up, and the appearances were the best for that day.
Clean up clean dishes
I drink a lot of palgong tea !!!!!
Insals ...
If you put Americano in soda, you can drink it with coffee tonic! Then put it in and drink it
Palgongti alba vlog 5 also can not put up ㅠㅠㅠ really addictive awesome 💜 I'm watching fun !! It'll be hard because it's Alba straight!
Do you remember the third grade of Yongmun !!!! ㅠㅠ I want to try Everland Alba!
No matter what, it's true that Australia is a better working environment.
My nephew also left the company after working for a long time in AEA. I live in New Zealand.
I watched the video. Slightly crying
It's infinitely repeatable to dance ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
Shouldn't you enter a large company in Australia? Why is everybody a worker in Australia?
Wow ... what?
What work?
At least get a visa. To leave in a year
Let's congratulate you, I'm so happy and happy to see you headed for a new path.
Bgm is good at the beginning of the video.
Oh ~ pretty
I'm curious about my bag when I go to work! haha
Sister Burberry Coat information ... I'm so pretty ... Of course my sister is pretty because she's wearing.
And I watched YouTube often
You may not know, but when you beat the egg, beat it and roll the egg! Then it can be broken in half and spread in two.
You shouldn't be doing this here.
Oh it's really lol
It was amazing to get to New York and cross the cable car when crossing the bridge. I feel it every time, but I think everyone is good. And at the very beginning, I looked at Lenny's feet and it seemed as if tiredness was written. You've been sick because you're standing still .. You've worked hard to fly for a long time. Thank you for uploading the video frequently. Nod
Should I write in English? No way ... why should I? She is Korean. Lol .. I also work in a foreign country. Dayun? Is this your name? Today, I'm watching YouTube. I'm so empathetic. Living is similar to me. Exercise, rice, work.
I'll pick you up. Killing points. You can always hear the sound of ice and beans.
There is someone who looks like Kwon Jae Seung
This is a healing video ..!
Cute
6:30 you call that clean?
I'm leaving for the first time today but still congratulations ♡♡ Emotional images ^^ I will run more cool life ♡
Oh, it's fun. You should have fun.
There will be more careers than you do now.
I enjoyed the video. So pretty !! Can you tell me where the lip products you put on after 7:58?
I want to go to Palgongti !! There's no bitterness around here ㅠㅠ Good video thanks :)
Interesting, in Brazil we always drink the coffee when it ’s hot, never cold, even in the summer
Korea is a Hell Joseon I have a lot of jobs, but I still wanted to live in Korea.
There's a guy in my class who's got that song
I think mosquito dance is better.
It's my first time seeing you leave. Your heart will be cool.
The face is classy and elegantly pretty. I hope you never touched my face. Plastic KAL, Asiana and other domestic crew members are uncomfortable because of the heterogeneity, dissension, and unnaturalness.
I want to take one more teacher's class 109
If you go to a place where there is a time difference, like your America, how do you live? I'm very tired. Do you have any tips? haha
Reporting IU Towing cables sseomnel ㅋㅋ
I live in the United States, but there are a lot of people who live in a beautiful house with a Mercedes. Throw away the earliest
Sir I am.
Here is the best looking handsome ~~! ^^
I think VLog quality is really great ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠ I really want to imitate @@@@@@
Busan is a vehicle registration office.
What company do you go to ??? ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
I feel like you are coming to Australia for a similar reason. Australian permanent residence has become increasingly difficult. I think it's really sky and land when compared to two years ago. Please plan well and dream!
It's like a palgongti in our area.
Crew is dreaming high school student !! Please upload a lot of useful videos in the future !!!
Anyway, look at the happy working look good ~~~ Good luck ~~ ♡
Do you know any Brown bag information? I'm so sleepy
I think it's pretty even if my lip color is light
you are handsome
From the last time I joined the training, and flying and looking at the photos, I was embarrassed by tears, I have a lot of photos like Dayun. In particular, I took pictures with tears when I was training.
 Korea is not an advanced country, why do you compare?
You should follow your luck
Lerenim> _ <Youtube look good Eh yong ㅎ ㅎ Please upload frequently!
Pretty, true
I'm curious, are the crew bringing their luggage on board? Or is it consignment ??? Will there be any liquid restrictions on board if I am on board?
Please let me know if I need to be more outstanding.
This is so fun
Australian whites are imbued with incomes from industries they don't want to do. If there is anything else, it gives a lot of money and a lot of vacation than Korea ㅋㅋㅋ Actually, it is a 3D industry that white people do not like to do. If you don't have a job, white people will clean up and cook and do construction work. I'm not going to do the 3D industry which is the field. If somebody has to do it, but they don't do it, they'll have to bring somebody to do it?
Hyebin
Because it is foreign.
What does the foam look like? First time watching the video
If you get a little bit of money from a big company and are just rolled like a part and are not promoted to an executive, is the job you cut when you are late 40 or 50? I went to a big company and left the company now. Seemingly smearing is not a good job. On-time commute, early morning commute, weekend work and stress, so it's a valuable job to get ready for a short time when you are over 40. There are some people who think it's weird. In large corporations, employees, especially white-collar workers, tend to handle parts.
I didn't throw this buzzword to say the right answer or to persuade someone who thought different from me.
Do you offer everything from airlines to hotels or transportation to hotels?
Edit all the fun stuff
How much do you usually pay for New York flights?
What is Palgongti?
I will sleep while healing. ♥ ️
Even if you do things like cleaning or farming, I hope you will make another investment for the future.
Black folks are so cute ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
If you look at the football highlights, that football player is good. It's okay but it's also a disadvantage. But I'm envious that my life's leisure time coexists, not the center of my life.
I live hard
The big companies in Korea are doing one thing and giving them a lot of money. Find a job that you can work for a long time
Your job is good and you don't have people. You're trained not to talk uncomfortable, but because of this, you're more likely to change your mind. I prefer white color to blue color. Think about whoever is the most expensive trader in the past and who still ignores them. There is still a slave class.
You need to know how to calculate money
I'm just timid, it's shrinking. I hope you'll be happy to find my job in Korea. If you can go to Australia ~
It's called light, some ice cream!
Why am I impressed ㅎㅎㅎ This video makes you want to go to Everland ~ I want to see more dance ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
What does it feel like to play adult without a mother?
The song "Love Shot"
You mean milk FOAM ??
It's underneath ~!
Rough breath
New start cheer! Whatever you do, Dayun will do well.
Congratulations and cheer for the new start ~
It so satisfy
While watching the video, I thought that you were really talented as a video production and youtuber ~ ^^
The annual salary of construction workers in Sydney is 120 million. Listening to the people who live in person .. less .. in the country where the preferential treatment of workers 욤 ~ I feel about what you are saying in the video .. I'm a smoker and I give up. Do you know? Australia costs between 35,000 and 40,000 won. haha
It looks really good to see the casts playing together like that.
Then let's do both of you !!
It's so fun, like living life.
To law school. There are three acquaintances around Jeju Island, but both of them are law school.
Please watch our video and if you enjoyed it please subscribe
EDIT What do you do?
If my pants are allowed now, can I stick to my legs with large scars?
Do you wake up on time? Timing top
Do the coffee drinkers add sugar? Or is the milk a sweetened milk, that it doesnt need sugar?
Please let me know where you bought your pajamas.
Look at a lot of exercise ~
😎👍
Say goodbye when you get off the taxi.
This is my first video but you leave
Chew me up
Did you leave?
Look away and don't be jealous or envious
Hi, i come form vietnam.I feel very sad when watching your video.I hope you are always happy and successful on your selection ❤️
Love this video so much😊 So calming and satisfying ~
If you don't have a job, you'll be a janitor in Korea.
Did you learn coffee separately?
A country like Australia doesn't do home papers? I'm curious
I'm afraid. Is it a lens?
why do you hide people their faces they all look the same lmao
I will cheer for a new start :)
I used to be an crew of my imagination by watching Dayun's V-log.
I am a teacher but this is my dream Job.
Harvesting wool wool brother Australia's positive achievements
4. I used to carry my laptop in my luggage, but I used to take my laptop battery out and carry it in my luggage. But for some reason, I care about it before I ride. If you don't have a battery and don't have a problem, let's do it in the future.
I have a question, are you spraying the aroma spray just to smell it?
John Ye ...
Where is the coat ?! It's so pretty
I saw you today, but it's your subscription. I'm going to let my peers know as soon as possible.
I'm from Vietnam, i luv your video❤️❤️
The most obviously beautiful flight attendants are the uniforms.
Korea must be on the net right now
I suffered. I look forward to living happily in the future.
What's so pretty in the morning? Honestly, are you conscious of your camera, makeup and sleeping?
Is it Palgongti, Hayang-eup, Gyeongsan? I don't think it's a long distance, but it stays ㅠㅠ I live at the very end of Daegu. If I cross one crosswalk, it's Gyeongsan.
I want to eat cool milk tea ㅎㅎ
I envy you, no money, no English.
Love your video 💖
What?
New York atmosphere is so good
You have to use your own room. I knew two Korean airlines had two.
If you're going to learn Australian shuffle dance
We will upload a lot of interesting videos with various stories and topics. Thank you.
I want to work with you .... Australia
Good to see
I don't have any earphones .. Don't torture 😭 I'll go home and see you right now Sarameyo ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
It's a devil's channel that I see until the end, but it looks like a distant person.
Thank you so much !! I'm dreaming of a flight attendant while watching my sister. I'm always happy
It also contains the princess working 👍🏻👍🏻
Bees also recognize flowers.
Actually, I'm still working in the technology field. I really want to slap and immigrate.
I heard from the kangaroo factory that it's a finger harpoon ...
Isn't it a civil servant?
I have a moment in a kangaroo factory.
I think it's a difference in personality and life values. It may be extreme, but even if it's your choice, even if it's hard, stressful, low-paying, and overtime, you can do it. I don't feel that life gets so long as I get older.
It's dry and there are animals in my house
I watched the video sometimes but I didn't know if it was Jihyun
Can I have a cafe apron?
The video is so clean 💗
살아 Live in South Korea ...
I love how people look like this 💕💕
Are you an emerging religion?
When I turned to my second job, I got double salary. But every day, eleven o'clock, eleven o'clock. Occasionally, twelve o'clock.
Sister! Do you work in Sokcho? Jackpot. After college class, I go to a friend once every two weeks!
If you make a lot of money, you can put that profession under me.
Daily makeup video please take !!
  Congratulations!
I always support you
Oh, I've been having fun.
https://youtu.be/fWRTs7cX_A8
At first, when you chose a job, you said that it was important for you to choose a job, but even if you have a good salary in Korea, you chose to do something else. I also worked one day a week off. Sometimes I worked for 10 consecutive days. At that time, I'm a slave or a person. It was hard to make a lot of money back then. Koreans work so hard. Perception should change as soon as possible.
If you envy you say envy, idiots lol
I like this brother
I just have a hard time living, but the woman has a house, a car, and lives better than she can.

It's all beautiful memories after seeing what you didn't like.
As long as it's hard, if you have the right treatment and social affairs, I wonder if Samsung Samsung will be able to do anything.
It's hard to even get a job.
Let's shoot lovely .... ㅠㅠ
You're back now
After two parental leave, it has been five months since I left the company, but I've been immersed in my daily life for a long time. I think you're a junior.
It's a good job for others, but you have a hard time dealing with services or selling duty-free goods.
It's so healed when you put it on once! LOL
Congratulations on starting
I used to eat milk tea at a convenience store
Because I'm good at it
The video is so clean
So you're ending your life in Dubai and coming to Korea?
Korea also seems to be going in the same direction as Australia after a while. Now it's a transitional period.
If you look at Qatar Airways or your Emirates friends, you can't last three years.
I've been watching it. It's the last flight ... The video is sad.
Now I'm lingering as an instructor at the Crew Training Institute in Auckland.
How old are the workers? Amusement Park Alba It's funny because I want to do it, but I think it's a little late.
If you have memorized all the drink recipes
Diet..?
Thank you .... I'll see you on your daily vlog.
There are only two feelings you will never forget
Thanks

Problem with this video
Foreigners, Chinese, Vietnamese, 400, 500 times a month.
Good luck dayun..love from Malaysia ♥
I'm watching your videos and I'm enjoyiiing
Oh look at the many comments here ㅋ ㅋ What did he do so well? Go out and smoke them for 30 minutes or chew them.
I want to die. I don't want to live my life.
I think there are no money and only money
Parallax adaptation, standing work view, body care, make-up (cosmetic change), skin care, etc. just look at the video seems to be a very hard job. I always think the stewardess is respectful and proud. In some cases, stewardess is snorting, but it seems that they don't seem to be all of them.
On March 10 next year, Yun Tzuku will go to Everland together.
I sure you will miss flying again. Anyway good luck for your second chapter of life🍀
Wow, just do not say anything and make coffee, but it's funny .. Strange addictive, ㅠ ❤️❤️ I have never been around even if there is a palgongti Can you tell me the recommended menu or popular?! ?? I want to go there
I don't know when it will come, but it's strange to watch the video for some reason! Good job 🙌🏻
Oh, the crew everyday is amazing> <!!! Clarisonic Toppu is coming! I'll subscribe and visit often> <
Do you have a camera calibration? What do you do with the white filter? I'm so curious !!
If you go with Yoon Tzu-ku!
The makeup is super cool
I just turn the camera on and work quietly
I'm sorry
Thank you to all the staff who gave you a smile and fun at Everland since childhood. ♥
Live without forgetting memories
I'm looking at the pictures at the end of the video and why am I crying?
Is Asiana not interfering with crew YouTube or SNS? I'm curious to hear that Dan Gong is not my goal. You're so cool.
+) I'm adding pearl to the green tea latte, or do you have green tea milk tea?
Is this celebrity? So pretty
My friend answered everything, don't answer me
In the meantime, I watched the video very well !! I'll look forward to your daily vlog !! Parting🌈
There is no return to the job, but ...
It's amazing to be a new jade Apple Pay
Really cute
Why do you turn on Katok PC version at work? ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
Somehow there was a reason to wait for the video. Are you enjoying the life of unemployed? LOL
Do you have pearl in Mango Smoothie?
Congratulations! The RENEIGN V LOGO is really fun and so much fun for the crew who are preparing the crew! Thank you very much for uploading your video.
I don't wanna break down like a machine
1. When a friend needs something to drink or something, it's better not to press the button on the crew in the seat, but to come to the bar at the back and ask directly. Sometimes, when you go back, the crew is eating and having a rest. I'm confused as to what's better because I'm actually sitting and calling and waiting or moving around and I don't feel uncomfortable because I want to work less uncomfortable but I wondered what would be better !!
So pretty ㅠㅠㅠ
Wow, it's so cheap. Palgongti?
I want to immigrate to Australia if I only speak English but I want to go back to my welding technology career.
According to the exchange rate, it will cost 320,000 won to 400,000 won, and it will eat for 1 hour.
Nice woman !! Subscribe ~~ ^^
Aren't cat hairs flying? Nya can't stand it because of the hair.

Where is the area?
Why are the comments dirty?
the ingredients they prepared or you made it according to costumer order? interesting more flavor you make it.
Wow Pyeonmusong's name is also unique and funny, so every time I go to Amazon, I have a lot of memories, but I'm glad to see you on Youtube ㅎㅎㅎ
I was so curious every time I saw you
Wow, it's really pretty. I watched a pretty thing in the morning in the drama.

There is no job in your job ~~ You don't have your job ~~~ In other words, if you want to eat and live in your own way, you have to take care of yourself ~~ In addition, there is a job in your job because it is a human society ~~~ Don't do it ~~~
What visa do you have now?
Is it different from Kaohsiung Milking and Korea Milk Tea ??? When I went before, I said that milk and tea flavors are different, but I don't know the difference.

Samsung S-Life Insurance Planner Why are you talking initials? Wouldn't it be better to pay taxes and get a return? What do you think about health insurance and pensions? Are you healthy right now, but if you get sick? Can I learn car maintenance without going to college? It's still early, so I have a lot of thoughts and dreams. I just envy your youth
But are the crew and pilots resting in the interflight area? Or do you work?
As an Australian experience
If you have time to pour out hate into inferiority, live your life or work hard.

Oh my god.
And you give me a lot of smoothies.
Show me your face often. I'm frustrated because I can't see my face.
You live freely. envious. I am now a big company and I am programming and translating with the belief that freedom is important with money. On the other hand, I've always lived with the desire to be a mechanic. Feeling parallel theory? I hope you live healthy and travel well all over the world.
It's unfair, but it's so pretty.
1. All non-conceptual remarks, such as swear words and personal attacks
It's hard to say that there is more importance than job return. I agree with you ~~ I'm a mechanic. It's always !!

I love you and love you
I hope you have a good day
It's finished ..

+ Additional question: How does pearl taste?
Emphasize that I'm originally this kind of person?
It was already 20 minutes later, and the house was covered with white smoke because of pan oil .... It was the largest residential complex in Sydney Town.
Can anyone explain !?
Last together> _ <
The face is pretty and the video is pretty
There must be a last.
What is the brand's name ??
Executives have a private office.
Oh you are wearing uniform pants !! It looks so comfortable
Good job 🥰
You work when you watch the video. You have the right to pursue happiness.
And when you are having a hard time gaining energy from your friends, when you are happy, there are many people to share with.
I just waited for Pagong Tee Vlog.

Then by mistake. . Recommendation. . Lol
24 hours a day
The Korean society is so hard and exhausted that I went to Australia and finally I am satisfied with the fact that I am satisfied with my life in Australia.
I'm not proud of cleaning ... and no matter how unclean, cleaning is right bottom life ..
Until now, most office workers around me have been like me.
When I came to three fire trucks and tried to break the door with an ax, I opened the door. About 200 people escaped because of the fire alarm.
What are you doing?
I dream of becoming an office worker
Crew # 1 community Jeonhyeoncha https://cafe.naver.com/sheiszzz Come visit the cafe ^^ Good information I'm going to see well ~

WELCOME TO Express
I think that I have the determination to leave, so the values ​​are clear and I'm going through the world well.
There is no return to your job, and there is a return to your character!

What hope do you have for sushi fish and what do you dream about?
Why is the cat's tail cut off ?!
Palgongti should give him a lot of money.
What I'm talking about is, apart from salary, there are some big cultural companies, some of them aren't big companies.
Wow, you're so pretty.
Want to get a green card?
👍
I think that the current generation of Koreans, who are in their 60's and 60's, who are currently struggling with politics, should retire and change quickly
I want to go over this make-up daily but I wonder if you used shadow mash
Oh, my first video is a resignation video.
Lere! ㅠㅠ I'm looking at it so much !!! I feel like I'm going to layover together. I want to see you later!

Did you live in Gyeongsang-do?
It's also a diet for lunch, egg dinner and tteokbokki.
ㅋㅋㅋ It's funny that those who came out of the financial field did not think that the video is a tax evasion advertisement.
I think it's lovely and human over this side!
24:00
Watch the video ...

I watched the video well. The video is so pretty and my sister is so pretty!
'Australian Slave' is returning home, but a new Australian man has appeared.

So nice to see I laughed and remembered how happy I was when I was at Everland in 1994 ~ 7. I hope you will be happy and happy for a long time.
I had a hard time working today
Fighting
Dayun?
In order to get a green card, I went to a culinary school I didn't think of, and I got a green card after 3 years (RSMS visa). I ran really hard to get a green card. Did I come here to suffer from work at 11 pm after work? I heard a meeting, but even though I was a little tired, I was happier than Korea in terms of mentality.
Because being happy in a foreign country is a new experience.
It's a bit of a fresh start
Last Nezan Killing Point
What's the name of another cat?
Everyone is old and forgets to cast, and they can't adapt to their jobs and re-enter them, or they're working for a similar type of job like Everland.
You're also out of here.
It's 24 hours ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ I love you sister❤️💛🧡💚💙💜
For the same reason I am in Canada. So nice to meet you ^ ^ Do you have no homesickness or longing for family?
I want to come to Australia better.
18:22 That's right Australian prices are so expensive

You live so hard. I respect you. I agree with you 100%. It's a lot like you. Thumb up, subscribe. I want to see you live hard. Fighting ~!
What does milk foam taste?
Australia also has a lot of taxes on permanent residence. It takes quite a while now to go to TAFE and go through the permanent residence process.
Can you tell me the name of the cafè that you work in? It seems like a really good cafè!
But I hope to meet you as a YouTuber ~~ ^^ Would you take a little rest? Come back healthy! 👍👍
What program do you use for editing?
Every time I watch a video, it's so healing
💛
Can't you just work in s group? Is cleaning and delivery your goal? It's hard for me to understand the people who go out of the university and go to the factory. It's for the children, but the dog really asks the children what they want. They sell their children to vanity. There's not a lot of S-groups that went before the hourly pay now.
I watched a video
I'm so envious of my work and life
Please take a lot of good videos and upload it in the future ❤
The image is very nice.
Just tae tae! ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
I like your video😍
I am an interpreter at a Korean public agency. I came to Australia seven years ago and work for an aged welfare care company. I am best at welfare and usually start at 7:30 am and go home at 4 am. I am married to an Australian man, but my husband leaves work around 4 pm and spends the afternoon and night at home. On weekends, they go to the beach or barbecue to National Park. Not manual labor in Korea but much more satisfying and happy. Husbands also share the household chores and cook alternately. After a while, I plan to buy a caravan with my husband and travel around Australia.
I saw you for the first time today. Last flight. Flower Walk 💝
4:54 Your sister!
Seulgi is always pretty !!
It should be noticed that this is not a dog that is raised in a company, but there is no real answer.
The real cafe vlog is Jihyun's best!
I first saw you today. Are you leaving Korea because of perfume?
Where did you come from?
Congratulations to 1,000 subscribers! Vlog (feat.Mukbang) I'm always watching well lol I'm looking forward to the next video
Oh, Ashana's flight attendants also have pants uniforms!
There are 15 subscribers, but the article is 1,000 true stories.
That was the welcome celebration of Amazon.
me too . .rectal. .4 times. . now. .
But if you eat it like that, don't you hungry? ㅠㅠ
One of the most missed places in Korea ㅠ Nice to see you in a long time ㅎㅎㅎ
What are you using?
Now is the end
Three and a half years ... as a person who raises the dream of airlines .... I feel a sense of weakness ... You see a lot of videos that say that you quit the aviation job like crew .... Of course, their Willing to stop there ... Every time I watch a video like this, is this job extremely hard? I'm starting to think that the dreams of airlines that I have grown up will disappear after only three months of work, and I feel like I've been studying so far.
Is there a litter?
1:27 Oh, I'm pretty ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
I agree I like to subscribe ........
There is no return to the job, but the treatment difference by rank seems big ㅋㅋ Nice to meet you. I work as an offshore plant engineer in Australia.
This video is also the best ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ 😂
It would be better if the background was foreign
Anyone who has achieved his goals correctly will be able to do other things as well. Always support and be happy.
All the drinks looks so delicious 🤤
I think there's hope of having more opportunities.
Are you leaving and doing youtubers?
What happen? Occupation
I was happy to share my good experience.
I love this
I want to be a flight attendant too.
Now
What taste is milk foam?
Now you can get me a job ^^
??? Palgongti If the original ice, the pearl goes into the base ..? We put 3,000 won in pearl .. ????? ying .. ?????? Mojo .. ??
The house is very spacious
Don't worry about me always, but just say you want to do this.
I'll play and eat, let's cut the boss or cut the salary
Wishing you the best, Dayun! With love from Singapore! Waiting to see your next chapter!
I'll ignore the two dogs
Jihyun's video is always like watching the ASMR video! I feel good when I see the sound of ice sticking and sticking to the pot before boiling the pearl. ㅠ ❤️ Thank you for a good video ❤️
I love bubble tea so much !! And that looks very yummy!
May I ask what it tastes like? :-)
Mind admire, this is the way you choose, so keep throwing away the big companies and why not go to Australia, don't worry about your job, just cheer me up. I'm 80 years old. Each one has its own priorities and values, whether it's a hard-worker or hardworker in the corner, there's no superiority in individual behavior and no reason for us to judge.
08:13 Ah nyc ...
Oh, and I want to see the ice in the cup often.
The picture I took with my colleagues at last
If you don't want to live in pain, you have to give one, take a break or make money.
You're so pretty..💗
If you were in Korea, would you have been able to build a specific plan with the dream of going abroad if you entered SMEs?
I saw it for the first time. I subscribed for one minute because it was annoying to subscribe.
As the space gets longer, small and medium businesses go.
Good Luck❤
When the crew members went abroad, they thought that they would take a rest and stay at the hotel. It's amazing, I like this vlog ~~
If you ask me where is the monthly salary college, I know it's an excuse, but I'm so curious .. I'm just curious.
I miss Australia. Of course, it's hard to make money there. But in Korean society, we just ignore workers, workers, and factory workers. Australia doesn't ignore anything I do. I think it was the best.
Here and there
The content is also useful. Please upload the video frequently.
May I be number one fan
pls update more
Ah jihyun's cafe vlog is the most fun in the world
About 1 million won per month. Cleaning Day 4 hours 5 hours 2 million won a day. 3 million won including other days. Never short of Australian prices. Suddenly, I'm in Wora Valley, Australia! I want to ... Travel around the world in Australia!
헉 ㅠ ̑̈ I have the same name as my name. ❤️ ♥ ️

Wow, it's funny.
I heard love shot in the bckground 😍😍
Have you been around 6 months? I'm also curious about the age and the Japanese atmosphere
You are wonderful. Discrimination is huge in Japan.
I envy you a lot of money.
I think I watched more Korean programs than when I lived in Korea.
In my life, I felt that the individualistic (?) Social atmosphere was more dominant than the idea of ​​Guicheon.
I love your videos a lot!
I have a question, is there a difference between a menu that seals and a menu that you do not?
I really wanna try those bubble teas, they all have such a unique name and flavor
This vlog is over time
I was surprised to scoop up suddenly. I did this. I have been struggling a lot ~ Everything will be fine Dayun :) Cheer!
Long time ago, but TT TT trench is so pretty .. Where did you buy it?
My sister is a personal idea but I think she looks like Suzy ㅠㅠ ❤
meu sonho de consumo é beber essas bebida tumblr deve ser mt bom
When I go to my school in front of my school, I always feel nervous when I put a straw together. Please let me know if you have any know-how !!
thank u for the subtitl💗🖤
It's ideal to get up once I'm stretched Ugh ... ahhhh! Should be refreshed
Lip information
I pressed this video to watch it
I need money.
These days, I don't have double eyelids but those big eyes look so pretty !!!
The lens you put on the video is so pretty.
Thank you so much for being so positive. I feel like my depressed mind is falling off.
Lol
It's a blue bottle near Bryant Park.
What kind of camera do you use?
Milk Foam Americano
It's not bad to boil pearls before the open preparations! I went early to eat bubble tea, but I waited 30 minutes because I wasn't boiling pearl
Fighting
envy
Thank you for uploading your videos in Australia.
Here in the cafe area I want to try milk tea
ㄹㅇ
I was surprised by the sudden news.
When I watch a video, I want to drink coffee 😭
Can I get some moisture cream information?
Wow, I really want to go to Palgongti. Every time I see it, the drinks look so delicious.
Is the tension crazy?
I don't know what it is but it's funny
Good job. Go for a better future.
Wow Sam Sam! (1-4 class student in the school)
5:52 love shot were playing in the background 😂💛🤩
wow amazing that the viewers has turned to 1M! you should post more videos as im addicted to this kind of video!
The last time I watched the video, I had a matcha palgon tea.
1:01
After watching this video, I'm working hard and I'm going to see you in your room a few years later.
I feel so good
And it's best to do what you like, but if you can't do that, you'd better try to like it.
Wow, is it possible to get up, eat and sleep again ??? I envy you.
It seems like an hourly salary of $ 23 is worth $ 16 to $ 17 in Malvern.
Do you know anyone who has a name from 5:30 seconds?
I think I should tell you .. Where do you live for your personal protection? Even if you do not want to be reflected in the camera.
I'm afraid.
It's Asian ~~ 👏👏👏👏
What is your height?
I waited so much for the video to come ㅠㅠ I didn't skip to the end
I watched the video steadily, and it's been a long time. I'm leaving. I'm curious about the reason why you quit.
It's like the contract term ends.
The internal combustion engine isn't going away ...
I'm not kidding. You're pretty.
Can you add the arabic or english sub * please?
Ah hahahaha
Seul-nim What is your usual weight management? Forty-somethings. Do you diet regularly?
If you wake up in the morning and wake up, you have to go to work again.
From vlog images
Both the typeface and the background are sniping ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
There are a lot of twisted people .. It's ironic. Don't worry about it.
Why are you so pretty?
If you buy it
Traditions and cultural customs that came down to our Korean generation were judges, prosecutors, doctors and omnipotent people. Until the age of our adult gods!
In fact, I'm still not sure what I really want and do well.
ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
What the hell is impossible? ㅋㅋㅋ The house is not that big. What kind of envy do you have? If you think that this basic thing is practically impossible, you should think about whether your life is right.
Do one in English please! I know you can speak it well !! :-D
Why is there a white cloth?
I want to try Cafe Alba, but I can't even challenge because it's difficult at first.
I'm curious about Treren's trench! Can you tell me where the product is? 💟
Just youth
ASMR people look so much like Dream You! It's so pretty
3:57 Wow .. These little kids are awesome these days. When I was young, I had to buy good slush from the front door of the school.
Hundreds of subscribers! Congratulations Lere.❤
There's a knife crew who left the company and made a big success as a Yu ~~ ^^
I watched it without knowing it was going to video time !!!
I wasn't close to Yongin, why did I rap?
I'll clean it up. Whether you're looking at it or not, Seulgi has been very cute since he was young. While you are trying to live happily, Lee Ye-yong, you are happy ㅋㅋ You know. ᆢ Your self is faithful and passionate about studying.
I've been working on a knife ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
Nowadays, I'm fat, so my lunch is half-boiled
There's also the most immersive concentration of cafe vlog videos ever, and you'll see it while you're immersed in it.
We watched with recommended video. I'm not seeing you for the first time. I think I meet you personally. ^^ Anyway, have a good weekend and I will support you. I will visit you often. Thank you.
Im happy with this vlog 😍😍
I love your vids how do manage I ca n’t even manage studying lol XD
Please take a video to introduce Slime later! 💗
ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
I'm good at business,
How old is this sister?
Wow ... I've taken a video in my neighborhood so it's amazing ... I'll come play sometime.
Thank you always ~
It's hard work ..
Life of gratitude and happiness
The reason why money is important is that in Korea, there are so many places that are equally overtime and not working even on weekends.
What's the product you applied to your skin in the video ~~ ???
Please take a picture of your sister !!!!
When I look back at life when I'm about 60 years old, I've lived a good life.
It's a one-person corporate office.
Why are you putting this up? Cleaning really makes a lot of money if you do well in Korea.
Handsome my style
I was elementary school student. I was influenced by my friends ..
The dog is pretty
I have a personal question. Do you have any retirement age as a crew member? Whether domestic or overseas.
That's immigrants. That's why Australian immigration policy is constantly changing. The immigration policy that Australians don't want to take is coming from a young and tax-paying kid from abroad. The Australian immigration policy will never change. Delivering 3D jobs from abroad that centenarians don't want to do. Also called immigration business. Australia is a country that makes money through immigration policy ^^
The Korean feature is that it draws fewer people and forces individual sacrifice.
How much is the pumpkin juice you eat?
Wow .. I saw it for the first time today.
Are you leaving your company?
Beauty
OMG .you are leaving Emirate. I am glad to watch all your videos. Until then good luck with your new job.Cheer
If you look at this cafe vlog, you will be healed.
Your name is the same as my dad ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
I have a bad job.
These look so good and now I ca n’t wait to try palgong tea in Toronto 💘
Oh my girl looks like Beanie.
First of all, the following situations will be unconditionally blocked.
I also ran 67 at speeding 60 degrees and I got angry and depressed because I was flying a day.
But I always wondered,
As a result of my hard work in Australia, I am now a 30-year-old working as a business owner, rental car manager, full-time and restaurant chef part-time. If you work hard, you can succeed ... and happiness index is high
22:56 TWICE Chaeyoung ...?
So pretty
Did you do your eyelash perm ??? I'm curious
I told you when I came to our school before.
I believe there is misery where all life is born. It is life that struggles to overcome it, so I think it is cruel but in a different way happiness comes.
I'm seeing the video for the first time. My sister is so pretty.
New watcher here! Thank you for sharing! Now I want some of these drinks now xD
I watched the video well. I saw something to learn, so I pressed Kudok's super hyo
What kind of phone do you use?
10 times a year I'm going to Korea from New York to New York. I feel like I'm not walking with my shoes.
My sister is so pretty ~~
This is a career class. I subscribed.
Can I say hello when I come to this Palgongti?
I mean, I'm envious of the courage to ride a plane for more than 10 hours.
What does it taste like when you eat espresso and soda? First combination!
It's so pretty
I watched the video well. International flight attendants are going to have a hard time. I'll take a rest soon. I'll eat. I can only remember. Even if you're adapted, it's like living a dream. Thanks to this, I got a hair loss shampoo. Next time please show me a lot of pretty faces ^^
And I was surprised once again that the manager sold his house for a year,
I want to see Palgongti
Seulgi sister to work in the company ♥ ★ ♥
I've been waiting for a long time !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
tmi but I really wanted to be a flight attendant ...... I'm not even 160 degrees ... ㅎㅎㅎ But I want to fly someday ㅎ ㅎㅎㅎ _ ㅎㅎ ㅎㅎㅎ ㅎㅎㅎ
The Republic of Korea collected the people's taxes and raised them
You are going to get a green card for maintenance.
There are more full grievances, but all life cannot be without grievances.
Not leaving the contract
It's nice to see you through YouTube ^^
I'm watching my first video now.
Hello, you're working as a law firm? And I like eggs as a whole.
Honestly, pine nuts Korea pine rice Shiru-teok executives are better off earning money than paying the public service tax.
Has anyone else being gong on binge watches of different Cafe Vlogs on Youtube or is it just me? lol these are calming to watch
Why are you leaving?
Korean people go to the western side
I don't know how old you are, but I have a car.
Get married to me
Today I was dragged into a cup of shunnell palgongti and watched ㅎㅎㅎ If you have a cafe called Palgongti, I want to go and eat it.
ㅠㅠ why did you quit if you do not mind answering.
I love the day video
The day of the crew is amazing! It's an easy job to travel with, but it's a lot more unfamiliar. Have a good look !! Thank you for uploading this video
As I participated in the course, I saw the hardships of the staff with my own eyes, and in the meantime, I was very pleasant! I was in the middle of the program because I didn't have any pleasant memories because of the relationship.
This is Mercy. Do you sit down watching the 23-minute video?
I watched Vlog ~
And why do you think you're crazy about shooting this video?
I'll go subscribe and go! It seems to be a good stimulus !!
I want to work at Everland
Are you doing this?
2:10 Thank you ..
10 minutes right now
Show me your face. I'm dizzy. I miss the style. And the video is so fast.
What's your hair loss shampoo?
I was really lucky I lived in Australia
i just found my new favorite youtube channel. ❤️
It's too bad, and the fourth drop doesn't fit the company's image.
Lift profile 1 second IU
Yoon Tzu-kuk left the company on August 30.
You're such a person, and I'm a person like that.
Wherever you look, I will always be filled with good things ^^
1:07 AAAAA
I feel once again while watching this video. Korea is a country where people are aware of everything.
Are you busy again?
Alba of my fantasy was originally a PC room, but turned into a cafe Alba ...... Real video 👍
These cafe vlogs make me so hungry! I always end up being so calm after the video. Amazing, pleasing video! Love you ~! ☆ ♡
Many people in their early 30s are in their mid-20s, but they think it would be possible for them to live a life like that ... Two cats and a large house. They think it would be possible to achieve this in their late 20s;
However, how to solve the grievance about life history is a real fun and the biggest homework of life history.
It's always a word that lasts, and I think it's a word that makes people sank ~ I wanted to be a flight attendant, but I had to fold that dream, so I was always disappointed by watching Dayun's video ~ I've struggled and congratulations on leaving again ~ I look forward to seeing you again!
Thanks for inspiring talk! It's the same situation right now. I'm leaving a big company and going to Australia
I'm just tightening it up and the drinks look so delicious 💓💓
Crew vlog Okay 💕 Your skin is honey! Isn't Whole Food Quacamole really delicious?
You're not healthy? Go to Korea, eat a lot of good food,
I don't care how I apply concealer.
What should I do if my apron is torn?
I saw you today for the first time, I'm sorry
But who knows what an intro song is?
This is so amazing ❤️
It's fun!
If you are in Gwangju
I'm envious ... I want to be so free at lunchtime I follow the shooter all the time
I should live like this later .. (˃̶͈̀ ロ ˂̶͈́) ੭ꠥ⁾⁾
If you can, it's the right choice!
I was getting $ 20 for cleaning in Cairns, Australia. Of course it's a cache. Twenty dollars is good but it's not true
It's still far
I envy you ♥
I saw Slime ad well.
I can see some healing
Adaptation problems
Do you prove that you were a full-time employee at Samsung? If that doesn't work, I can only think of it as a video upload.
Is it two jobs?
Going into a good job
My sister is so pretty and cute. I really like real video. Thank you.
How old are you?
Lereni Have you been a crew member for many years ?? I want to know about crew members.
What kind of dough do you make like that
I'm watching her video so well !! My dream is a flight attendant, but thanks to the videos that make me want to be a flight attendant more than ever. . ??? ㅠㅠ hsk certification or TOEIC high score I think I can do it really hard ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ I will really appreciate if you answer ❣️ And finally my sister is so pretty!
In retrospect, I just did what others told me to do
2:59
I like this video!
I suffered from serving in the air.
And Lere, you're so pretty. Always fighting.
Good job ~~
I think I can be held at work .... I don't think double employment is a problem.
Jang Sung-kyu ...
It's a matter of consciousness anyway.
I started watching cafe vlogs last week and your channel is my favorite. Sending lots of love
I usually don't watch long videos, but I didn't know how to go
💖💖👍
Trench is too pretty, can I get some information ???! ❤❤❤
It's not just happiness to win the competition, it's not just happiness, but society and parents are forced to do it. So leaving your environment may be the answer.
I want to be a cat
I like this detailed vlog so much
Even if the woman in the video is a goldsmith, that's not wrong.
i want a job like this!
And I ate at the size up at the store
I returned home from Canberra until 2007 as a cleaning contact. It's nice to meet you. I have a lot of contacts who eat 10 dollars per hour.
I want to scout you.
Do I have to go ??
You will be tired of going to Seulgi company.
ㅋㅋㅋ If you eat deliciously, it's 0 calories ~~ ㅋㅋㅋ
Moo and Rio are so pretty ㅠㅠ 💕
Oh, by watching this video, I have a fantasy about Café Alba. ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
Dancing swords,
Is your face content?
You're amazing .. I went to small business in Vietnam and started YouTube as a hobby.
ㅡ When I go to Milan, I always go to the Duomo by train, but sometimes I get one from the top of Crew.
I've been struggling for a while. I can't imagine how many unforgettable memories of flying. I am so wonderful❤️ I wish you happiness on every road ahead 🙏🏻
Well, as a person who lives in Korea for a lifetime and tries to find happiness here, I've thought about how I would go out, but I think it's too late now ;;;;
I keep watching it and fill it with everything ... Smoothie lid? I was surprised to escape.
For three and a half years, I had a hard time living as a flight attendant in the Emirates !! I will always support you for a happier day ☺️
Some drinks are sealed and every drink has a different lid standard ??
It's hard to have a leisurely life in Korea. Young people are hard at work.
I was so sympathetic, wondering if I had made a custom to rationalize myself who chose to look better than what I like. I cheer for you. Cheer up ~
Can I add pearl to all of Palgongti's drinks?
I waited a long time. What kind of drinks are you sealing and what are you? What is the standard for inserting into ..? !!
It doesn't look like Tapioca Pearl in Lemon Green Tea, but Ji Hyun-chan's favorite menu.
The most beloved vlog
You didn't eat ramen
All the cats like angels are the only cats
But the more I hear these words,
That ’s a lot of ice
This is the first time I left a comment .. ♥ ︎_ ♥ ︎ I wanted to say this..❤️ Hehe
I'm MALAYSIAN but I really want to KOREA taste this😍
What is so addictive?
my sister got me hooked on your videos and watching your vids makes me want to work in a bubble tea cafe. do you recommend people to work in one ??? lol btw im studying estheics and this is the job i want lmfao
I wish you all the best in your new work.
ㅎㅎ teeth and teeth are healthy. Korea is also doing a good job cleaning the home cleaning business. Leaving the trace of used car TV hurdle.
Looks happy ♡
I'm in Vlog these days ... Subscribe to 👍👍
Do you not know that tteokbokki is forbidden when dieting?
From January 2016 to January 2017, I went to Warhol, Australia, and went to a chicken factory and a small factory. I got up early in the morning and finished after 1 or 2 pm. It was my time. I didn't have to try to build specs or study TOEIC like crazy, and I lived with my sister, my brother, who grilled pork belly and StarCraft teammates together. I went to the sea, went to catch crabs, went to skydiving, and it was the best memory of my life.
I saw so much ^^
Oh please upload it to full version
Oh yeah, but the crew left many. Why? It's a personal matter, but ... Is it because flight time or personal time is irregular? The conditions are nice. I'm in a big company and I'm young and I've left with confidence. ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ It's not easy! Right now I have some regrets ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ;; Of course you'll be good at doing other things too! You suffered anyway
Thank you so much for today's beautiful video ㅠㅠㅠ I will see you well before going to bed ❤️❤️❤️
If you don't like the video, don't use it and turn it off to another channel.
뀨
Ah .. I have you late at night.
Jihyun peck!
For 2-30s who have a higher education, share with the world on the internet and yearn for freedom, Korea is a hell because of braids.
Do you sleep with a lens ~
ugly
I pretend to think about it, and it's annoying for me to turn around. ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
Why she what to quit?
22:10 Cute dogs LOL
Please upload a lot of blogs.
It's so cute to play with slime.
Even if it's a problem, even if it's a problem, why don't you get tired of going through the sex fight unconditionally?
I left my job as a researcher for an automobile company.
Oh my god! Do you live in the same neighborhood as me?!? I go to the park and take a lot of selfies.
I will finish this day with this video
If a Japanese person comes to a cafe and the staff doesn't speak Japanese, what should I do?
Wow everyone is amazing ~! If you are jealous
What do you do with video editing?
Hi I love your channel so much we see you ’from Saudi Arabia💜🙇🏼‍♀️
Thanks for your efforts
I'm envious of free soul ~ ♡
Someone says that if you're the boss of a company, you're not a woman, so you're sick? ㅋㅋㅋ ;;
Please tell me your aroma spray information.
I'm curious because I don't know anything Is he paying really high? I think I spend more than 2 ~ 30,000 won per meal. And I stay in Dubai for 6 days and buy this and stay in a hotel. Can I do it with the company welfare card?
Always healthy
Everland went to Everland on October 29th, but he was worried
I'm a mid-sized equipment company and I'm just a Joseon ship; I'll die.
Fairy ... I'm always watching the video ying !!! 💗 It's my style ... Is there anything you would like to recommend?
I think I'll remember all the menu names here ...
From Mexico, I wish you good luck pretty!
The sheep are crazy.
I understand what you said about the company. Especially considering the company culture, it would be more difficult. Anyway, I pray that you will find and live the life you want in Australia.
Seulgimim Do you know what you are doing ...!?
Hope you everything good in the future ^^
I'll be the first one I've ever seen vlog for no reason.
Seolgi, do you not have breakfast?
I always look good !! Today is especially longer and so good ~! ~ !! But when playing with slime, the background sound is too sad ㅠㅠ slime sound is buried .. But it's a daily video ㅎㅎ I watched well today !! Frequently Raised
New York flight .... I respect it !!
You work really hard.🙄
Can you tell me some futon information ???
My sister is in front of the bathroom!
If you work until 9-15 o'clock on cleaning day, you can work for 2 hours of Uber Eats.
Can you tell me what you are using vlog app ...! It's neat so it looks nice !! ♥
I live in Canada, but I still think that if I stop getting a visa, I won't even have a chance to get a visa from other Koreans. It's a personal idea, don't mind. In Canada, because of them, many immigrants don't get a chance. I want to know how. It's so nice to see you!
Do you have a Korean boss in Australia who gives you Korean wages?
you are so Beautiful 😍😘😘
I saw it for the first time today. It's the last flight.
It's my first time to spray moisture cream !! Where are you going?
What's the taste of matcha and oolong?
Why are cats' tails?
What's the difference between sealing and not !? Is it sealing only certain drinks?
If you look at the title, you're falling out of a big company.
How many kills are in the same video ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
Do you know where you are? 🙆‍♀️💕
Hyebin is so cute ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ What should I do?
Will Korea change slowly? Just as the system and citizenship can't change rapidly, we have to move slowly toward the quality of life. In the comments, I think I have a fantasy about Australia comparing Korea to Australia. I have lived abroad, but there are advantages and disadvantages. As a latecomer, Korea needs time. But the answer is that those who are hell in Korea are leaving.
Wow, I'm still nagging. It's going to be hard. I feel like I've only seen Goodnight.
I hope you will face the future as it is now.
Haybrow Houses Going Its Prekin Out
I cleaned up about 10 years ago in Wolworth, Australia, and that was my happiest time. I spend money on my money and spend my time on it.
7:30 It was a bit childish but fresh.
I'm so dizzy I'm dizzy
The kangaroo is suddenly attacked from behind I heard a kangaroo standing in front of the window
Have you ever been to Seongnam-dong?
I see a lot of hidden meals
I am not happy with my Korean experience and free from abroad? I will tell you about the happiness of watching a lot of videos coming out on YouTube these days.
I watched Lere's video and wanted to contact you.
cool!!
I woke up and gave me a tip to keep my bangs intact ... I'm a bandit when I wake up.
Anyway, congratulations on your return to Korea, but I miss you.
You're off the contract too!
It's my first job watching QnA video, and I'm still young and I think it's a waste to lengthen my crew as a major, English, spec, talent,
You could add pearl to Ade!
LOL ~ Cool! Long distance flight !! It may be hard! But the plane is always fluttering
It's a pity ^^
1:47 It's hard to read depending on the speed of the subtitles.
 Countries with a lower economy than Korea have a lot of jobs.
Healed sugar ~
I'm good at it.
I didn't know at this time.
I told you to live
Australian life is perfect
I am a young man who lives the same way.
It ’s great to eat at night. 💎✨
Faster with an egg spoon (spring from a sponge as a child)
It was a pity that someone scrambled the hard-working YouTube channel and its videos and made money with advertising revenue through Aggro Castle title.
It was skeptical that I lived hard in Korea .;
Honestly, I'm not talking about this video alone ... Dying in Korea Every time I see slaves, I feel miserable and miserable.
Court information point ㅠㅠ
It's so nice to have a nice and relaxed life ^^ Subscriber +1
It's a shame that there are many people who don't believe it anyway, try to shave others, they are angry and think differently, as if their thoughts are correct, and there is no productive conversation.
Hello I cleaned my office 10 years ago in Brisbane and now I'm working as a bank clerk and I want to leave but I'm so frustrated that Korea's job is disappointing and my parents are disappointed.
Australia is very racist. Have you ever experienced streamers?
Let's go.
Who knows what song is singing at 0:48
I'm so pretty.
I watched the video ~ Do you know what it is like to be a beauty technician in Australia?
You look like you're a beautiful woman. Cat Mae Mae-ju's bag of cats
I'm a 30 year old who wants to start studying millet, but English is too hard.
8:25 8:25 8:25
It's a case so similar to my cousin's brother. If Australian immigration is fickle and you decide to live, I hope you have a good permanent residence!
Don't forget that passion!
I think I'll get a lot of numbers from you ... Oh yeah.
Even now !!
It's really delicious honey milk tea
Do you think you charge your phone while you charge it?
great job! I want to work same as you. Pls eng sub every clip 🥺
One day, we will come to an era where people place more importance on individual life than money.
Do you know what species of cat Rio is?
I served seven years as a soldier in the US military, right after I was discharged from the Korean army, and the most memorable difference was the way of thinking about people who were similar to what you said. In the Korean military, soldiers and high-ranking people were no different from each other as if they were novices or gods. The most memorable thing was the organization. No matter what class I was, I usually walked through the troops and was able to talk frankly or joke about the problems of the troops. I was very impressed with Colonel's respect as a comparable human being, even when he was dealing with second-rate illness.
Beauty loves pomegranate
There is a return
When I wake up, I'm envious of meows

It's my only chance to watch Palgongti's Alba Vlog .... I'm so happy to see your favorite brand Alba video❤️❤️❤️
I lived in Australia and it reminded me of college students. I used to be mines in Australia for two months when I was on vacation with my friends.
Is it the Emirates that spawned many football clubs?
Oh, it's funny. I'm showing you 18/19. It's funny. ㅠㅠㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ I really want to see more harmless laugh codes.
Watching café vlogs even if I don't like coffee 😅 I always watch the most random videos ...
When I was abroad, I came to Korea, and there are so many lives that live my life at the level of others.
Is there anything like racism?
There is a beginning.
It's obvious that I ate a half-boiled egg for lunch, but it's almost like to have tteokbokki in the evening.
Hello, Jihyun!
Oh, you really had no egg soup
Good job! I've had fun in the meantime and I'll wait for other daily life :)
Oh why the comment window here ... I feel good;
Occupational disease
I can't stop at this point, Gaaz.
I traveled to Asiana in Germany and everyone was so kind and impressed. I want to go to New York later.
I think it's my first time to see people who are doing well after quitting
I hope you have more fun and good things in the future :)
I suffer a lot in Australia
I wanted to be a favorite youtuber, but I like the video and the atmosphere is good !!
I use a Canon G7X Mark2 and the camera looks similar ??? What do you use, and what kind of editing program do you use?
I'm Suzy
Super pretty. English subtitles please 😬
I saw it for the first time and it was fun.
It's so pretty, but it's weird not to be crazy.
I'm a gangster as a reference to my job.
I also want my cat to bother me every morning and when I wake up.
Ok ... those smoothies got me: V
Of course there are kebakke, but all the motivations I've seen
It looks like a douche
A little bit of experience in Australia .. If you spend a million dollars, Australia is better to live.
i love you :))
I'm uploading more videos
It was so scary to go back to Australia to do farming, cleaning, and restaurant work.
The video is dizzy. The shaking is so bad that I get dizzy
Youth is wonderful.

I still remember that it was bright and sticky.
Good job
My face is getting angry today
I loove u so much

Lonely and loneliness alone how great it was. To do what I want to do is a sacrifice, but I struggled too cheer up!
Now I've finally earned a level of income that I can't earn in Australia.

Craving for boba after watching this🤭
It 's a bit of a bitch. I'm Samsung. I went to Australia for $ 23 .. 200,000 a day.
If you're higher than the person on the spot, where is your job?
The lake is so used to cats and neatness?
Im watching this while drinking boba lol.
He's just gonna do it
And you are a perfect goddess
Good to see you 😊 10 minutes went by! (Cutting)
This is my first time seeing you! You're lovely too! I will continue to see

It looks good. On the one hand, it's a pity. Young talent
Seulgi is pretty and Nya is so cute
My acquaintance is also from Sky and I'm at Hyundai and I'm currently tiled in Australia. Faye is strong and the family is happy. It's hard work.
Please be careful of low quality people in the future. Meet some good-educated friends.
It's easy to make alba noodles so I like it

Jihyun's video is the cleanest and beautiful
I'm not happy and I'm so depressed ...
Good job 🙂
Even when he was over 40, he saw his desperate uncle working as an hourly unit. Yolo is good and short-term salary is good, but the future is usually the majority ... … …
I'm running to see the thumbnails before I watched the real video. Sister I Love You ㅠ 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Wow, this brand is the first time to hear it !! I don't have near my house or school. I look forward to seeing you next video
Long ah x long o
I saw it for the first time today. It's sad together. I think you were doing well.
You have a bruise on my hands .... it's that ok
It's addictive and I still look at it
Innomu's labor conditions seem to have no real answer. But these days it's 52 hours a week.
There was a future for the kids. Of course, all of our assets are now entering the mainstream, working in high places and living well.
I don't know how to slice eggs
Thank you so much for your work.
I'm a novice youtuber, so I'm constantly uploading video
Việt Nam đâu rồi
What are you proud of going to other countries and living with beggars?
Today, I pressed my subscription.
I'd also like to see Get Ready with Me VLOG !!!
Wow ... that's the makeup of the cosmetics.
It's like Sokcho
Coats
It was so cute to have a hair band and tteokbokki ㅠㅠㅠ ❤️
Palgongti ,? It's really my love ... If you don't have bubble tea, you can't buy it. It's a light. .. I think I should go buy Palgongti.
It was a great amount of video haha ​​It was a great video for all generations ^^ <
Is there a bubble add 500 won?
1:50 This girl is steamed ...
Everland greetings Hello I love you
Omg i like this work someday
I don't wear makeup if my makeup looks like that
I think it's a good word for youth.
If you're still living in Australia, you should be a little worried. It was helpful :)
The 3rd job of 8 years of small and medium-sized business .. The 1st job leaves the work out at 10 o'clock every day, the 2nd job can't take a day, but the annual fee is freed for the third year. I'm having a hard time because of my boss. No matter where I work, it's a minefield and I'm not really happy. The most difficult thing is the braided culture that divides people up and down and thinks as a means, emotional labor, and noticing culture that makes it impossible to rest when you want to rest. I dreamed of living abroad, but now I'm living in Kuyeokku station to move to a slightly happy job.
It is the life of a livestock that misunderstands that he is a human being.
I'm so envious of the time that I can spend alone with my working time, so it's a good day!
I don't know what I've done with the s group, but it's hard to find an Australian job. You don't understand English and don't get into mainstream so you don't know what it is.
I really had goosebumps after I'd watched it
You may have felt a lot of loneliness alone in a foreign country, too. A lot of hard work :) Please go back and relax and enjoy the flowers!
I'm celebrity

ㅋㅋㅋ This is enough to take two cats, and students who think that they are full of spacious homes / multi-storey offices and have a relaxed life should be able to leave it soon. All..
I have a question. I know that the crew is working on a plane. Why do you see time in the country you arrived in?
No job
The subscribers will know how loneliness and arduousness they were crazy about because of the bright and healthy video.
I want to live like this when he is an adult.

Mr. President, why don't you try the Australian TAB agency betting business as a side job?
If I went to Korea I would love to go there everyday 💜❤️💜
I watched two omelet videos today and eat and go to work! I'll support you 😊😊
We are attracted to the dusty stone without any breaks.
Oh, I'm here now. I'm late for 2 hours because of my damn exam. Have lunch Why eat so little? It's bothersome when you eat eggs and you're happy when you're eating the dogs. Put on selfies taken at the park Oh oh jjokteok match I also had no rice cake in my area. The smell is so good. The video is so fun today. The video is so long and real.
Yes, Samsung production.
But when you're in Korea or in Australia, it doesn't seem to make any difference. I think there's no big difference from imports from Korea, considering the actual price from leaving tax at $ 220,000. Just a leisure. Working environment ... Never compare. And no touch until age 75. This can never be converted into money.
After all diet from tomorrow!
Por cierto que son esas cosas? 1:03
They're lawyers like us, doctors, there's nothing to look up at.
But it seems that the survival of the fittest in such a place has grown so much in the world. In countries without resources and technology, concentration and competition of people are indispensable.

Do you want president?
He seemed to rationalize himself as if he was immersed in a collective consciousness.
Take care of your health in Korea ~
Ooh, the cat 🐱 is cute. Sister I bought slime, but it's too hard to pour, so you can add glycerin. Where can I find it? I just got it on my hand, and where did you get that face band, it's really cute
I'm a lady from Australia.
I feel better when I leave
Do you have a male crew?

It's better if you don't touch it
I love this vlog too. No, but Renee's non-montamont beauty and skin are really ... pretty .... 😭💕
The lives of the sick and the general are also different.
After about fifteen years, the company's motives are managers, and they're especially struggling.
I'm going to get off my head because I'm out of work
I've been watching the crew life.
Watching your vlogs make me want to be a barista again 🥺
What is the name of the cafe!?!?!?

Is there a lei nim shampoo as a hair loss line?

After a while, I'm sorry. At least I'm sorry. I am a student with a dream crew, but I have a lot of questions, but I can't solve my question. If you don't mind me, can you please let me know by e-mail?
헉 .. I live in Gyeongsan!-!
Cat is so cute
My sister grew up dreaming while watching Vlog, but she said that she was leaving, so I was crying for me.
ㅡ It's because of my heart.
The logo reminds me of troom troom lol
I'm so envious of all the crews looking so friendly and free.
Your vids are therapeutic!

Similar to Jung Chae Yeon,
I'm waiting for the first SEP update soon :) I've been tired of my life in Dubai for the first year of my life. I think I'm going to tear up watching something ~ You've had a hard time! I'll cheer you up !!
I get a green card earlier than I expected, so I live happily.
Sister beauty is real national treasure., Seulgi is really a princess.
Where is this place! ?? And i wanna name this coffee shop
Last flight another start fighting !!!!!
You are now.
I had a lot of fun but it's the last time, but always patting you ~~ ^^
It's not important to make people, but if money is the most important thing, it's better to go to a large Korean company. Money is important.

What's going on when my sisters pass by?
Cool
It's so healing ~~ ☺ Cats are so pretty
Sorry for the too late comments 😂
Work and life should be neat
I watched the video so much fun ^^ It looks like you're really diligent.
As a result of working in a production job, I have a labor intensity that is not a life as a person, but a human slave machine that is worse than a dog. I'm standing all day to make less than two hundred dollars, and I can't stand my body's sensation gradually. I can't stand the white collar and black collar as black collar.
The video quality is very amazing
Ani ... It's so funny.
Nyan guys are so cute
Do you live Sokcho?
It's a tension in the world ...

Did you dry your hair before? Root volume is really awesome.
It's not cheap if you think about Australian service prices and industrial prices. Car repair costs $ 300 to go to engine oil
I'm a high school student who watched the video for the first time today! It was a very healing video for me that had a romance about the trace 😘😘😘 Subscribe 구독 Press 💗 I'll keep up with the other videos !!
My girlfriend is an Asian or flight attendant, but when I go to Rayop, I stay at the hostel and call around, but I was wondering what to do.
Excuse me, I have a little question.
This person is prettier than makeup? Novelty
This place is almost worried about Seulgi
Replying to
Personally, I think the layered hair goes so well together For reference, I'm learning beauty
Are you coming in?
There is no easy thing in the world
I think it's a difference between people. I like game convenience, public transportation, security food, and I like Korea. haha
It so delicious 😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😙
I also work abroad until this year and will be leaving the company.
Let's eat rice
I am also working overseas .. It is a culture that encourages time off from work.

So pretty
Is lemon green tea not iced in a cup? I wonder if it's cool even without ice

You're so pretty, you're so pretty !!

I wish I could come and try one of your drinks and also come seaport you because what you do is so cool!
I really like watching vlog, but Seulgi is really my taste. Oh and the world is dangerous. Seulgi is so pretty. I'm a couple face-washing band with me! Hi-Hi
I want to know the camera and pajamas information.
Do you live Sokcho?
I'm thinking about living a different life.
Your job depends on how much money you make, which is based on how much money you have, and was born in a poor home with no academic background.
This is what happens even before the ages
It's a real Palgongti Johnmattang.
There are so many memories
I'm a student with aviation and Asiana is number one. I hope to see you on board Asiana.
How do Korean girlfriends live when they meet foreigners? What will you do when you get married?
We hope to broaden the thinking of all subscribers who watch this video.
Two-room, tea, cat, game effort.
What do I eat when I'm depressed ...
I look forward to leaving this video, and I think I'll tear tears. You have been having a hard time and sincerely hope that you will walk in the future. ♡
Do you remember me?
Seulgi is a subscriber I've watched since I first uploaded the video ~! Congratulations on over 70,000 people already! ^^
sorry but that ’s too much ice for me lololol
People who are obsessed with the image of others who sees me, and I also have other people's occupations to evaluate them and define their relationships with them. Are there many people who constantly find the other's shortcomings, find their own superiority and live with satisfaction? Probably the origin of the profession comes from such a social atmosphere. Of course, there are no such tribes in Australia. However, if you expose it and ignore others, you can be treated as a barbarian who looks like you're missing, you can't learn, and you're less personal. That's a big difference between Korean and Australian society. Is it the difference between citizenship? In Korea, people sit together and appreciate each other and despise themselves. Therefore, Koreans have a lot of embarrassment when they come to Australia. There are a lot of people who are looking for a Korean mind that 'Guest is king' in Australia and are swearing because of unintentional controversy. Then tell me that I was racist in Korea. Anyway, I'm not interested here. If it's my comfort and my happiness, it's awesome. If you make a lot of money, you have to pay a lot of taxes, but there are some people who work hard and try to get more government subsidies.
It's the best. Really ㅠㅠㅠ I'll take care of it 😊 Handsome! ☺
I watched the video all the time, but I've been waiting for it all the time. I watched the video from the beginning to the end.
Honor
Fighting! ^^
?? Why do I not look makeup better?
If you think it's easy to be happy and unconditional, you'll be happy.
For three and a half years, I struggled to sleep properly in other places .... I support Vlog for another life of Dayun.

I've been working a lot, but, wrecking, wrecked menbung, scooping honey from australia, sucking, healing, and, again, meaninglessly repeating life every day without meaning. It's time to travel again soon :)
Do you have a seal or a flat lid or a convex lid for every drink?

Thank you so much
It's good to go to other countries and clean up when it's time to pay back to the community.
I love you. Cool. My future. I'm really tired of Korea
Great tip on the lint roller!
How can I make a foam like that? ㅎㅎㅎ I couldn't do it ㅠㅠ
I was surprised to see the thumbnail
It's going to be colder if you go to Canada in April. Unfortunately, OZ has no direct flights.
You're so pretty, envious ~! Video is always watching well! Have a nice day ~ ♡
