1 : Seulgi is a good subscriber to watch the video! I'm saying that the structure of the house in the video? I don't know until now, but I think you should watch the elevator and the place where you live. ㅠ ㅡ ㅠ I've seen other women's YouTube videos, but I heard that a strange man found a house and stalked it! I didn't know ..

21 : You worked so hard ~

27 : It's sad to see my hat flying at the end.

49 : This video is a little bit sad ..... ㅠ By this time, my sister went to school while watching the video ㅠㅠㅠ .... I also decided to study English.

50 : I've had 40 years of healing because I'm cleaning up and cleaning up dirty things. I still want to catch white women in and out of the office, but I don't use it in my eyes. When the bell is closed and the bell is pressed, the room is sold and the room is sold at 6 am, the coffee break for the guest, and the guest room is removed by 11 am. There is

51 : You suffered.

53 : 11:32 Samsung Pay is the answer!

54 : I'm envious of my house

56 : If you're envious, tell me you're envious, don't be sarcastic.

57 : I'm embarrassed that my first encounter is teething.

65 : I resign in 4/01 and leave on 30th. I'm so tired ~ I hate it so much that I want to kill myself by throwing stress on my family at some point. This is not ... This is not ...

70 : If you come to the Gold Coast if you get a chance, let's shoot together 🙏🏿

1324 : Fighting

74 : And basically, Korea is also highly dependent on exports, right? It's hard to eat and live in the domestic market, and even in Japan, it's enough to live in Korea.

89 : There is no Australia.

97 : No

98 : It's a pity .. I've studied badly in Korea and have an unprofessional job, so I work 14 hours a day and have no personal life at all.

104 : 1. The day I broke up with my first girlfriend.

113 : Rather, it feels like an insult to those who work hard in those three fields.

114 : My brother is thinking of leaving for Australia. My brother-in-law works in the field of technical jobs in Korea, but Korean companies only care about office work, and they don't literally think about mechanical parts. If they don't have a lot of work, they just cut people, and if they get too much work, they can't handle the existing people. Every time a person changes, it's hard to adjust to, and if you talk about your dissatisfaction, just be patient. The people in the field just literally opened up. This is a cabaret too, but my brother suffers from this a lot and wants to go to Australia where there is no discrimination in his job. In fact, my brother has been working in Australia for more than two years and has always told me that the Australian environment is so good. But even now it's hard. I'm already 31 years old, and I've despaired that I've exhausted my Warhol visa so it's virtually impossible to get to Australia. As a younger brother, I am not happy to see my brother doing it. I'm so sorry. I've worked hard in my own way, and I've been treated like a beggar, but I've been in Korea to immigrate to Australia. Stop the fort and just watch the pawn all day at home, you are dazed. Just lost the reason for life The appearance is itself. My heart is broken ... So I want to ask the creator. What's the way for a 31-year-old man who's already out of warhol visa to go to Australia and get a green card? My brother looked at the technology immigration side, and he said that the conditions are tricky. There are not a few states that require the technical skills you have, and even if you want to go to immigration, you need a college diploma. If you have a hard time with technical immigration right now, is there a way to find out about your chance to get a permanent resident daughter because you've exhausted your Warhol visa? I would be grateful if the producers could reply to you as far as I know ... ㅠ

162 : damn id go to this cafe daily if i didnt live in america

171 : If you want to do it, you're swearing; If you can't swear in front of Seulgi, don't be ill. If you ask me to take a cell phone at school, you will take pictures too; No, you can do it in a company. Students take pictures everyday at school, but you can also take a cell phone at school. Why don't you do it to them;

175 : Fighting!

239 : I've been working as an engineer for a heavy equipment company for over 20 years, and it's really different in Pay and Benebit than in car technology.

242 : Are you paying taxes? It's illegal for a cash job, but Australian slaves are taking unfair profits by renting a car, but be careful not to take pictures of such illegal activities without any hesitation.

252 : My wrist hurts a lot when I'm pulsal. I'm going to rub it hard, but I'm just going to cut it. But when I think about the shooting and editing efforts, it's too painful to watch.

266 : I also went to a large trading company in Korea and the salary was fine compared to Dong Nai, but I wasn't happy. However, my sister immigrated to Australia and lived here.

270 : No lens in the morning !!! ??

275 : Yeah, I regret it old ~

321 : Increasingly, the population decreases, the competitiveness is lost, and the society becomes sick as the fish in the sushi restaurant dries.

324 : Korea is in a bad mood because of its over time. There is a return to work in a foreign country. You just can't feel good with each other.

334 : What is your occupation? People live first. Those who have seen the end of stress know what I mean.

338 : It's mascara and no burr.

350 : One of the visitors to the hotel in Milan, a child enters and jumps while stepping on the rabbit ears, one of them is dead ..

394 : I have a hard time

395 : I don't know well, but is it different from Palgongti?

396 : I like it because the other place is too sweet pearl and can not control the sugar content that is not good ~ ㅎㅎ Palgongti is more fresh than other third-party pearl, but it seems to me good!

399 : I'm so sad

484 : I wonder if there is a country that is worse than Korea. .

499 : The original layered hair is a layered hair !! The layers are formed because the angle is cut, so it gets shorter and shorter as you go up !! If you don't like it, semi-layering will make it shorter.

502 : I was an executive at a famous foreign conglomerate in Seoul, Paris, Singapore, and a year and a half ago I was sick in Singapore. We had a meeting from 9 am to 2-3 am (our head office was calling with Paris New York). I live and die like this. I come to Paris and live with my crying son. It's slow down so I don't get sick anymore. Even if I make much less money, I can afford to live. I saw you from Nayu. Please win and subscribe. Please come to play Paris channel!

504 : There is no return in the occupation, but I think there is a return in man. This is certainly true if you look at Koreans who have written down their profession. If I say this to people who are citizens of high consciousness, I will be branded as a racist and it will be hard to live in my life.

523 : Keep up the hard work👍👍

527 : Congratulations on exceeding 1,000 subscribers ~ I am so sad and depressed that I will return to my daily life after getting off the plane back to Incheon. I didn't like the way of getting out. ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ

532 : Are you going to live alone?

544 :  I'm worried about finding a blue collar job, but in the end, why don't I just be happy with myself?

545 : I think it's a crazy concept

589 : I lived in Korea so I have something to say. envious.

591 : This is Seung Jun's lament that failed today.

605 : If they don't do that, they're gonna die, they'll study, doctors, lawyers.

606 : If you wipe it hard when you are young, the end of the year is good. The kids have a good future, they don't care about their old age. I was sad and tired at first

607 : What is the first place in the video because it's white? It wasn't Daegu Daegu Palgongti or Hayang Palgongti, so it's Gingaminga. I'm watching the video. You're fighting.

620 : I went to a foreign financial company a few years ago and hit the banking industry because it was so dirty.

722 :  Korea is not an advanced country, why do you compare?

733 : If you get a little bit of money from a big company and are just rolled like a part and are not promoted to an executive, is the job you cut when you are late 40 or 50? I went to a big company and left the company now. Seemingly smearing is not a good job. On-time commute, early morning commute, weekend work and stress, so it's a valuable job to get ready for a short time when you are over 40. There are some people who think it's weird. In large corporations, employees, especially white-collar workers, tend to handle parts.

737 : How much do you usually pay for New York flights?

742 : If you look at the football highlights, that football player is good. It's okay but it's also a disadvantage. But I'm envious that my life's leisure time coexists, not the center of my life.

743 : I live hard

773 : This is my first video but you leave

775 : Did you leave?

800 : I envy you, no money, no English.

818 : I think it's a difference in personality and life values. It may be extreme, but even if it's your choice, even if it's hard, stressful, low-paying, and overtime, you can do it. I don't feel that life gets so long as I get older.

835 : If you envy you say envy, idiots lol

848 :  I'm not proud of being out on my salary.

850 : Working hours are not the best among OECD countries

862 : I can't help but catch snatch and die, no matter how sns is my personal freedom.

865 : I'm sorry, how old are you?

881 : If you give me money, it's hard for Korea to work more.

889 : You have suffered

893 : I envy you young fighting !!!!

902 : I was misunderstood at first.

913 : As long as it's hard, if you have the right treatment and social affairs, I wonder if Samsung Samsung will be able to do anything.

990 : Why are the comments dirty?

1001 : Embarrassing

1013 : Samsung S-Life Insurance Planner Why are you talking initials? Wouldn't it be better to pay taxes and get a return? What do you think about health insurance and pensions? Are you healthy right now, but if you get sick? Can I learn car maintenance without going to college? It's still early, so I have a lot of thoughts and dreams. I just envy your youth

1016 : If you have time to pour out hate into inferiority, live your life or work hard.

1025 : But I don't want to put it off anymore

1027 : Face without makeup is pretty

1037 : I ask . . Bake. meal. Someone in Bicester. Someone is colored. Someone is motorcycle. Ooh, it hurts my evil spirits. Different Akai. Oh, you. Hee hee 💓

1042 : Stop jealousy ~

1052 : Show me your face often. I'm frustrated because I can't see my face.

1130 : There is no return to your job, and there is a return to your character!

1140 : Why is the cat's tail cut off ?!

1146 : I think that the current generation of Koreans, who are in their 60's and 60's, who are currently struggling with politics, should retire and change quickly

1148 : Oh, my first video is a resignation video.

1155 : Long time no see

1157 : I've been flying for a month now, .. These days mental and broken body ㅠㅠ ha ... I'm busy to hurry to seniors and very sad ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ I do not want to do personally when I go to Rayop? ?

1169 : I had a hard time working today

1172 : In order to get a green card, I went to a culinary school I didn't think of, and I got a green card after 3 years (RSMS visa). I ran really hard to get a green card. Did I come here to suffer from work at 11 pm after work? I heard a meeting, but even though I was a little tired, I was happier than Korea in terms of mentality.

1175 : Last Nezan Killing Point

1180 : For the same reason I am in Canada. So nice to meet you ^ ^ Do you have no homesickness or longing for family?

1203 : My sister's layover video is not good but my sister is good !!!!

1219 : Can't you just work in s group? Is cleaning and delivery your goal? It's hard for me to understand the people who go out of the university and go to the factory. It's for the children, but the dog really asks the children what they want. They sell their children to vanity. There's not a lot of S-groups that went before the hourly pay now.

1221 : I'm so envious of my work and life

1230 : It should be noticed that this is not a dog that is raised in a company, but there is no real answer.

1264 : I'll play and eat, let's cut the boss or cut the salary

1266 : I'll ignore the two dogs

1274 : If you don't want to live in pain, you have to give one, take a break or make money.

1277 : I saw it for the first time. I subscribed for one minute because it was annoying to subscribe.

1282 : I miss Australia. Of course, it's hard to make money there. But in Korean society, we just ignore workers, workers, and factory workers. Australia doesn't ignore anything I do. I think it was the best.

1290 : I bought this coconut coffee moody

1293 : I saw him before, but he wasn't kidding, 👀 dance dance

1355 : I'm not kidding. You're pretty.

1368 : What the hell is impossible? ㅋㅋㅋ The house is not that big. What kind of envy do you have? If you think that this basic thing is practically impossible, you should think about whether your life is right.

1371 : I want to try Cafe Alba, but I can't even challenge because it's difficult at first.

1393 : It's hard work ..

1405 : That's immigrants. That's why Australian immigration policy is constantly changing. The immigration policy that Australians don't want to take is coming from a young and tax-paying kid from abroad. The Australian immigration policy will never change. Delivering 3D jobs from abroad that centenarians don't want to do. Also called immigration business. Australia is a country that makes money through immigration policy ^^

1469 : Show me your face. I'm dizzy. I miss the style. And the video is so fast.

1470 : What's your hair loss shampoo?

1473 : It's too bad, and the fourth drop doesn't fit the company's image.

1490 : I don't care how I apply concealer.

1491 : What should I do if my apron is torn?

1492 : I saw you today for the first time, I'm sorry

1500 : I was getting $ 20 for cleaning in Cairns, Australia. Of course it's a cache. Twenty dollars is good but it's not true

1502 : I envy you ♥

1505 : Adaptation problems

1517 : I suffered from serving in the air.

1520 : I think I can be held at work .... I don't think double employment is a problem.

1527 : It's not just happiness to win the competition, it's not just happiness, but society and parents are forced to do it. So leaving your environment may be the answer.

1536 : You will be tired of going to Seulgi company.

1549 : It's hard to have a leisurely life in Korea. Young people are hard at work.

1567 : Do you not know that tteokbokki is forbidden when dieting?

1573 : If you don't like the video, don't use it and turn it off to another channel.

1579 : ugly

1580 : I pretend to think about it, and it's annoying for me to turn around. ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ

1585 : Even if it's a problem, even if it's a problem, why don't you get tired of going through the sex fight unconditionally?

1595 : Someone says that if you're the boss of a company, you're not a woman, so you're sick? ㅋㅋㅋ ;;

1608 : I'll be the first one I've ever seen vlog for no reason.

1617 : I live in Canada, but I still think that if I stop getting a visa, I won't even have a chance to get a visa from other Koreans. It's a personal idea, don't mind. In Canada, because of them, many immigrants don't get a chance. I want to know how. It's so nice to see you!

1625 : If you look at the title, you're falling out of a big company.

1626 : How many kills are in the same video ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ

1629 : Will Korea change slowly? Just as the system and citizenship can't change rapidly, we have to move slowly toward the quality of life. In the comments, I think I have a fantasy about Australia comparing Korea to Australia. I have lived abroad, but there are advantages and disadvantages. As a latecomer, Korea needs time. But the answer is that those who are hell in Korea are leaving.

1661 : Honestly, I'm not talking about this video alone ... Dying in Korea Every time I see slaves, I feel miserable and miserable.

1664 : It's a shame that there are many people who don't believe it anyway, try to shave others, they are angry and think differently, as if their thoughts are correct, and there is no productive conversation.

1665 : Hello I cleaned my office 10 years ago in Brisbane and now I'm working as a bank clerk and I want to leave but I'm so frustrated that Korea's job is disappointing and my parents are disappointed.

1666 : Australia is very racist. Have you ever experienced streamers?

1763 : I saw it for the first time today. It's sad together. I think you were doing well.

1766 : Innomu's labor conditions seem to have no real answer. But these days it's 52 hours a week.

1788 : The 3rd job of 8 years of small and medium-sized business .. The 1st job leaves the work out at 10 o'clock every day, the 2nd job can't take a day, but the annual fee is freed for the third year. I'm having a hard time because of my boss. No matter where I work, it's a minefield and I'm not really happy. The most difficult thing is the braided culture that divides people up and down and thinks as a means, emotional labor, and noticing culture that makes it impossible to rest when you want to rest. I dreamed of living abroad, but now I'm living in Kuyeokku station to move to a slightly happy job.

1789 : It is the life of a livestock that misunderstands that he is a human being.

1790 : I'm so envious of the time that I can spend alone with my working time, so it's a good day!

1791 : I don't know what I've done with the s group, but it's hard to find an Australian job. You don't understand English and don't get into mainstream so you don't know what it is.

1798 : No job

1808 : But when you're in Korea or in Australia, it doesn't seem to make any difference. I think there's no big difference from imports from Korea, considering the actual price from leaving tax at $ 220,000. Just a leisure. Working environment ... Never compare. And no touch until age 75. This can never be converted into money.

1825 : I was not happy at all with 15 hours of work experience. Ah, I'm gonna swear.

1838 : The lives of the sick and the general are also different.

1839 : After about fifteen years, the company's motives are managers, and they're especially struggling.

1845 : Is there a lei nim shampoo as a hair loss line?

1846 : There are a lot of menus in the world ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ We are not that bakery cafe, but how do you memorize all the recipes .... I suffer.

1852 : My sister grew up dreaming while watching Vlog, but she said that she was leaving, so I was crying for me.

1873 : Last flight another start fighting !!!!!

1882 : Sorry for the too late comments 😂

1885 : As a result of working in a production job, I have a labor intensity that is not a life as a person, but a human slave machine that is worse than a dog. I'm standing all day to make less than two hundred dollars, and I can't stand my body's sensation gradually. I can't stand the white collar and black collar as black collar.

1890 : It's a tension in the world ...

1911 : This place is almost worried about Seulgi

1925 : no fun;;

1928 : Korean big business conglomerates are really wicked to let three people do what they're supposed to do.

1942 : Your job depends on how much money you make, which is based on how much money you have, and was born in a poor home with no academic background.

1950 : What do I eat when I'm depressed ...

1955 : People who are obsessed with the image of others who sees me, and I also have other people's occupations to evaluate them and define their relationships with them. Are there many people who constantly find the other's shortcomings, find their own superiority and live with satisfaction? Probably the origin of the profession comes from such a social atmosphere. Of course, there are no such tribes in Australia. However, if you expose it and ignore others, you can be treated as a barbarian who looks like you're missing, you can't learn, and you're less personal. That's a big difference between Korean and Australian society. Is it the difference between citizenship? In Korea, people sit together and appreciate each other and despise themselves. Therefore, Koreans have a lot of embarrassment when they come to Australia. There are a lot of people who are looking for a Korean mind that 'Guest is king' in Australia and are swearing because of unintentional controversy. Then tell me that I was racist in Korea. Anyway, I'm not interested here. If it's my comfort and my happiness, it's awesome. If you make a lot of money, you have to pay a lot of taxes, but there are some people who work hard and try to get more government subsidies.

1959 : Fighting! ^^

1960 : ?? Why do I not look makeup better?

1977 : It's going to be colder if you go to Canada in April. Unfortunately, OZ has no direct flights.

1985 : It's a real story ...? It's so ridiculous

1997 : Isn't Australia the end of racism? I think it's hard
